1. **Dataset Sizes**:
- Real data: 100,000 rows
- Synthetic data: 330 rows
This significant size difference (synthetic is only 0.33% of real data) may impact some metrics.

2. **Numerical Statistics Analysis**:
- Age: Relatively good mean accuracy (only 3.6% error) but poor distribution (synthetic data clusters around 50)
- BMI: Moderate accuracy (25.4% error) with higher synthetic values (mean and quartiles shifted up)
- HbA1c_level: Poor accuracy (71.3% error) with significantly higher synthetic values
- Blood_glucose_level: Very poor accuracy (99.7% error) with synthetic values much higher than real data

3. **Categorical Similarity**:
- Gender distribution: Very good match (p-value ≈ 0.995, indicating no significant difference)
- Smoking_history: Good match statistically (p-value ≈ 0.994) but shows some categorical misalignment
- Binary variables (hypertension, heart_disease, diabetes): Show unusual patterns with unexpected values (e.g., values > 1 where should be binary)

4. **Feature Correlations**:
- Correlation matrix distance: 0.988 (high, indicating poor correlation preservation)
- Major correlation sign flips:
  - HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level: Real (positive 0.167) vs Synthetic (negative -0.191)
  - Age and blood_glucose_level: Real (positive 0.111) vs Synthetic (negative -0.435)

5. **Medical Consistency**:
- HbA1c-diabetes relationship: Poor preservation
  - Real: 1.538 difference between diabetic/non-diabetic
  - Synthetic: -0.064 (wrong direction)
- Glucose-diabetes relationship: Exaggerated
  - Real: 61.24 difference
  - Synthetic: 162.19 (much larger than real)

6. **Privacy Assessment**:
- Individual attribute violations are moderate:
  - Age: 17.1% violation rate
  - Gender: 0% violation rate (good)
  - BMI: 37.7% violation rate (concerning)
- Combined attributes show high violation rates:
  - Age+Gender+BMI: 57.4% violation rate (very concerning)

**Key Issues to Address**:
1. Binary variable encoding needs fixing (currently allows non-binary values)
2. Medical relationships are not properly preserved
3. Distribution of numerical variables needs improvement
4. Privacy protection needs enhancement, especially for combined attributes
5. Correlation structure preservation needs significant improvement

**Recommendations**:
1. Modify the prompt to enforce binary constraints
2. Add more medical domain constraints to the prompt
3. Include more specific distribution parameters in the prompt
4. Consider increasing the synthetic dataset size
5. Add correlation preservation guidelines to the prompt

Would you like me to help you modify the prompts to address these specific issues?
