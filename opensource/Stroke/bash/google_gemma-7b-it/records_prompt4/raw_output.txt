You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using the following rules:

- Stroke is more likely in patients who:  
  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
 

**Generate 100 records:**

```
Male,62,1,1,Yes,Private,Urban,120,80,formerly smoked,0
Female,58,0,0,No,Self-employed,Rural,80,50,never smoked,0
Male,72,1,1,Yes,Govt_job,Urban,140,90,smokes,1
...
```

**Please generate 100 records using the above rules.**

**Note:** The generated data will not be medical advice or diagnosis. It is for research purposes only.

**Output:**

```
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
Male,68,1,1,Yes,Private,Urban,130,70,formerly smoked,1
Female,52,0,0,No,Self-employed,Rural,90,60,never smoked,0
Male,76,1,1,Yes,Govt_job,Urban,150,80,smokes,1
...
```

**Please note that the generated data will be large, therefore I am only pasting a sample of the output.**

**Please generate 100 records.**

**Expected Output:**

The output will be a list of 100 comma-separated lines, each representing a patient record. The format of each line is:

```
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
```

The data generated will follow the specified rules and ranges, and will be realistic and reproducible.

  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
For example: Male, 55, 1, 0, Yes, Private, Urban, 80, 22, formerly smoked, 0

Generate 100 patient records.

**Additional rules:**

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using the following rules:

- Stroke is more likely in patients who:  
  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
  
Generate 100 synthetic patient records.

**Example:**
Male, 62, 1, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 80, 45, formerly smoked, 0

**Note:** This data generation process does not include any clinical notes or medical diagnoses. It only includes basic patient information and risk factors.

**Output:**

100 comma-separated lines, each representing a patient record, with the format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
For example: Male, 65, 1, 0, Yes, Private, Urban, 120, 42, formerly smoked, 0

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using the following rules:

- Stroke is more likely in patients who:  
  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
For example: Male, 65, 1, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 120, 50, formerly smoked, 0

**Generate 100 synthetic patient records:**

```
# Generate 100 synthetic patient records
for _ in range(100):
    gender = random.choice(['Male', 'Female'])
    age = random.randint(1, 82)
    hypertension = random.randint(0, 1)
    heart_disease = random.randint(0, 1)
    ever_married = random.choice(['Yes', 'No'])
    work_type = random.choice(['Private', 'Self-employed', 'Govt_job', 'children', 'Never_worked'])
    Residence_type = random.choice(['Urban', 'Rural'])
    avg_glucose_level = random.randint(55, 27)
    bmi = random.randint(10, 98)
    smoking_status = random.choice(['formerly smoked', 'never smoked', 'smokes', 'Unknown'])
    stroke = random.randint(0, 1)

    print(gender + "," + str(age) + "," + str(hypertension) + "," + str(heart_disease) + "," + ever_married + "," + work_type + "," + Residence_type + "," + str(avg_glucose_level) + "," + str(bmi) + "," + smoking_status + "," + str(stroke))
```

**Output:**

```
Male, 62, 1, 0, Yes, Private, Urban, 140, 60, formerly smoked, 0
Female, 70, 0, 1, No, Govt_job, Rural, 125, 80, never smoked, 1
Male, 55, 1, 0, Yes, Never_worked, Urban, 100, 30, smokes, 0
...
```

**Note:**

- The generated records will mimic the specified rules and ranges, but the values may not exactly match the exact boundaries of the ranges due to randomness.
- The generated records will be in the format specified in the output example.
- The output will include 100 records, each on a separate line.

**Output:**

```
Male, 62, 1, 0, Yes, Private, Urban, 72, 60, formerly smoked, 1
Female, 58, 0, 1, No, Self-employed, Rural, 80, 20, never smoked, 0
Male, 45, 1, 0, Yes, Govt_job, Urban, 60, 30, smokes, 0
