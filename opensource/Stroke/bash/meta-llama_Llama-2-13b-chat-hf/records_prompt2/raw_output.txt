1. gender: Patient's biological sex (Male/Female)  
2. age: Age in years (0.08-82) 
3. hypertension: High blood pressure diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes)  
4. heart_disease: Heart disease diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes)

1. gender: Patient's biological sex (Male/Female)  
2. age: Age in years (0.08-82) 
3. hypertension: High blood pressure diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes)
