Here are some additional features that you can use to generate more realistic records:

1. Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)
2. Cholesterol level
3. Body mass index (BMI)
4. Waist circumference
5. Hip circumference
6. Diseases other than hypertension and heart disease (e.g. diabetes, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc.)
7. Family history of stroke
8. Smoking status (formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown)
9. Alcohol consumption (frequent, occasional, or never)
10. Physical activity level (sedentary, light, moderate, or vigorous)

You can use these features to generate more realistic records.

Note: The data should be generated randomly and not based on any real-world data. The goal is to create a diverse set of records that can be used for training and testing machine learning models for stroke prediction.

Generate more records in the same format.

The purpose of this task is to generate realistic patient records for stroke prediction research. The records should include relevant information such as demographics, medical history, and lifestyle habits that could be used to predict the risk of stroke. The records should be diverse and cover a range of ages, genders, and medical conditions.
