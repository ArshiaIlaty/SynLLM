These patient records will be used to train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient having a stroke. The model will be trained on a variety of patient features, including age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, ever married, work type, residence type, average glucose level, bmi, smoking status, and stroke.

Please note that the data is synthetic and not based on any real data. These records are just examples and not meant to represent any actual patient data.

You can use any statistical distribution to generate these records. For example, you can use a normal distribution to generate the age, BMI, and glucose level, and a binomial distribution to generate the hypertension and heart disease variables. You can also use a categorical distribution to generate the work type and residence type variables.

I need realistic data that can be used to train a machine learning model for stroke prediction. The data should be balanced, i.e., there should be roughly the same number of patients with and without stroke. The data should also reflect the demographics and risk factors of a real-world population.

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.
Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using these statistics:

1. gender: Male (49%), Female (50%)  
2. age: Mean = 43.2, Std = 22.6, Range: 18.0–100.0  
3. hypertension: 0 = 90%, 1 = 10%  
4. heart_disease: 0 = 95%, 1 = 5%  
5. ever_married: Yes (65%), No (35%)  
6. work_type: Private (60%), Self-employed (20%), Govt_job (10%), children (5%), Never_worked (5%)  
7. Residence_type: Urban (50%), Rural (50%)  
8. avg_glucose_level: Mean = 106.1, Std = 45.3, Range = 55–250  
9. bmi: Mean = 28.1, Std = 7.5, Range = 15.0–60.0  
10. smoking_status: never smoked (40%), formerly smoked (20%), smokes (15%), Unknown (25%)  
11. stroke: 0 = 95%, 1 = 5%

Note: Each feature has a specific distribution and range. The goal is to generate realistic synthetic patient records that can be used for training and testing machine learning models for stroke prediction.

Each record should be a comma-separated line with the specified features. You can use the mean and standard deviation of the realistic statistics to generate the synthetic data.

You can use the following commands to generate the data:

python synth_data.py --gender-male 49 --gender-female 50 --age-mean 43.2 --age-std 22.6 --age-range 18.0–100.0 --hypertension-0 90 --hypertension-1 10 --heart-disease-0 95 --heart-disease-1 5 --ever-married-yes 65 --ever-married-no 35 --work-type-private 60 --work-type-self-employed 20 --work-type-govt-job 10 --work-type-children 5 --work-type-never-worked 5 --residence-type-urban 50 --residence-type-rural 50 --avg-glucose-level-mean 106.1 --avg-glucose-level-std 45.3 --avg-glucose-level-range 55–250 --bmi-mean 28.1 --bmi-std 7.5 --bmi-range 15.0–60.0 --smoking-status-never-smoked 40 --smoking-status-formerly-smoked 20 --smoking-status-smokes 15 --smoking-status-unknown 25 --stroke-0 95 --stroke-1 5

You can run the command to generate the synthetic data. The output will be a text file with the synthetic patient records.
