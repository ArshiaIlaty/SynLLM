In the above example, we have a male patient and a female patient. The male patient has a history of heart disease and a history of stroke.

Generate a more accurate representation of the patient's biological sex.

The first step in generating a patient record is to select a patient's biological sex. The second step is to select a patient's primary sex.

For example, if a patient is diagnosed with a heart disease, we might select a male patient's
