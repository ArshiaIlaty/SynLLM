You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.
Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using these statistics:

1. gender: Male (49%), Female (50%)  
2. age: Mean = 43.2, Std = 22.6, Range: 18.0–100.0  
3. hypertension: 0 = 90%, 1 = 10%  
4. heart_disease: 0 = 95%, 1 = 5%  
5. ever_married: Yes (65%), No (35%)  
6. work_type: Private (60%), Self-employed (20%), Govt_job (10%), children (5%), Never_worked (5%)  
7. Residence_type: Urban (50%), Rural (50%)

This code will generate 1000 synthetic records with the specified features and save them to a CSV file named'synthetic_data.csv'. You can adjust the number of records generated by changing the argument passed to the `generate_synthetic_data` function.

**Example Use Case:**

To use this code, simply copy and paste it into a Python environment, and run it. This will generate the synthetic data and save it to a CSV file. You can then load this data into a machine learning library such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow for analysis or modeling.

**Note:** This code uses the NumPy library to generate random numbers and the pandas library to create a DataFrame from the generated data. The `np.random.seed` function is used to ensure reproducibility of the generated data. The `np.random.choice` function is used to select random values from the specified distributions, and the `np.random.uniform` function is used to generate random numbers within the specified ranges. The `pd.DataFrame` function is used to create a DataFrame from the generated data. The `df.to_csv` function is used to save the DataFrame to a CSV file.

This Python code generates synthetic patient records for stroke prediction research. It uses NumPy and Pandas to create a DataFrame with the specified features and their corresponding statistics. The `np.random.choice` and `np.random.normal` functions are used to generate random values for each feature. The `clip` function is used to ensure that the generated values fall within the specified ranges. Finally, the DataFrame is saved to a CSV file named "synthetic_patient_records.csv".

Note: The generated synthetic patient records are for demonstration purposes only and should not be used for actual medical research or applications. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consult with medical experts and use actual patient data to generate realistic and accurate synthetic records. 

The output will be a CSV file containing the synthetic patient records. You can load this file into a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets to view the data. 

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

This code generates synthetic patient records with realistic statistics for stroke prediction research. The records are stored in a CSV file named `synthetic_patient_records.csv`. You can modify the statistics and the number of records to suit your specific needs.

Note that the code uses the `numpy` library to generate random numbers and the `pandas` library to create and manipulate DataFrames. The `np.random.seed(0)` line sets the random seed for reproducibility. You can change the seed value to generate different records.

To use this code, save it to a file (e.g., `synthetic_patient_records.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python synthetic_patient_records.py`). The generated CSV file will be saved in the same directory as the script. You can then use this file as input for your stroke prediction research.

```

This code uses the NumPy library to generate random values for each feature based on the provided statistics. It then clips the age and glucose level values to the specified ranges and converts the dictionary to a Pandas DataFrame. Finally, it saves the DataFrame to a text file named `synthetic_data.txt`.

Note that the `np.random.seed(0)` line sets the random seed for reproducibility, so you can get the same set of random values by running the code again. If you want to generate a different set of random values, you can remove this line or change the seed value. 

Also, the `header=False` argument in the `to_csv` method is used to prevent Pandas from writing column headers to the text file. If you want to include column headers, you can set `header=True`. 

The generated synthetic data will be saved to the `synthetic_data.txt` file in the current working directory. You can modify the file path or name as needed. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or need any modifications to the code. 

Example use case:
```bash
python synthetic_data_generator.py
```
This will generate the synthetic data and save it to the `synthetic_data.txt` file. You can then use this file as input for your stroke prediction research.

This code generates synthetic patient records based on the provided statistics. It uses the `random` module to generate random values for each feature. The `generate_patient_record` function generates a single patient record, and the `records` list comprehension generates 1000 such records. Finally, the records are saved to a CSV file. 

You can adjust the statistics and the number of records generated to suit your specific needs. 

Please note that this is a basic example and you may need to modify it to suit your specific use case. Also, the generated records are for demonstration purposes only and may not reflect real-world data. 

Note: This code is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any actual medical research or clinical decision-making without proper validation and verification. 

Also, remember that this is a simple example, and in real-world scenarios, you would need to consider more complex factors like correlations between features, non-linear relationships, and other nuances of real-world data. 

You can use this code as a starting point and modify it to suit your needs. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using these statistics:

1. gender: Male (49%), Female (50%)  
2. age: Mean = 43.2, Std = 22.6, Range: 18.0–100.0  
3. hypertension: 0 = 90%, 1 = 10%

Male, 37.0, 1, 1, Yes, Govt_job, Urban, 104.17, 23.4, Unknown, 0

# Generate 10,000 synthetic patient records

# Save the DataFrame to a CSV file
df.to_csv('synthetic_data.csv', index=False)
```

This code defines a dictionary `statistics` to store the statistics for each feature. It then defines a function `generate_synthetic_data` to generate synthetic patient records based on these statistics. The function uses NumPy's `random.choice` function to select values from the statistics dictionary for each feature. The function returns a pandas DataFrame containing the generated synthetic patient records. Finally, the code generates 10,000 synthetic patient records and saves them to a CSV file named `synthetic_data.csv`.  The CSV file will have the following structure:
```
gender,age,hypertension,heart_disease,ever_married,work_type,Residence_type,avg_glucose_level,bmi,smoking_status,stroke
Male,38.85,0,1,Yes,Private,Urban,105.43,28.31,formerly smoked,0
Female,62.23,0,0,Yes,Self-employed,Rural,202.85,27.91,never smoked,1
Male,81.42,1,1,Yes,Private,Rural,105.92,32.51,smokes,1
Female,49.19,0,0,Yes,Self-employed,Urban,171.29,27.77,never smoked,0
Male,36.85,1,1,Yes,Govt_job,Urban,104.17,23.45,Unknown,0

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.
Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using these statistics:

1. gender: Male (49%), Female (50%)  
2. age: Mean = 43.2, Std = 22.6, Range: 18.0–100.0  
3. hypertension: 0 = 90%, 1 = 10%  
4. heart_disease: 0 = 95%, 1 = 5%  
5. ever_married: Yes (65%), No (35%)  
6. work_type: Private (60%), Self-employed (20%), Govt_job (10%), children (5%), Never_worked (5%)  
7. Residence_type: Urban (50%), Rural (50%)  
8. avg_glucose_level: Mean = 106.1, Std = 45.3, Range = 55–250  
9. bmi: Mean = 28.1, Std = 7.5, Range = 15.0–60.0  
10. smoking_status: never smoked (40%), formerly smoked (20%), smokes (15%), Unknown (25%)  
11. stroke: 0 = 95%, 1 = 5%
