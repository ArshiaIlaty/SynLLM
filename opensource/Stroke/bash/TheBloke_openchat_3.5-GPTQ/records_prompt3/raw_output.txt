GPT4 System: You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke prediction research.
Human: You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.
Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
