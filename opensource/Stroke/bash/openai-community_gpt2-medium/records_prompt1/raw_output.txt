SQLSER is a powerful data mining framework for medical data. It is used by the medical research community to identify and predict the clinical events that may be associated with a specific disease or condition. It is also used by medical researchers to develop a treatment strategy for a specific disease or condition.

1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82

Generate more records in the same format.

The first step is to generate a record, and then to select a set of features to generate the record. For example, to generate a record of patients with diabetes, we would use the features below:

1. gender: Male, Female 

2. age: between 0.08 and 82 

3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes

4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes

5. ever_married: Yes or No

6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked

7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural

8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27

9. bmi: between 10 and 98

10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown

11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke

Now, we can generate a record for stroke:

1. male: Male, Female 

2. female: Female, Female 

3. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke

Now, we can generate a record for stroke:

1. male: Male, Female 

2. female: Female, Female 

3. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke

Now, we can generate a record for stroke:

1. male: Male, Female 

2. female: Female, Female 

3. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke

Now, we can generate a record for stroke:

1. male: Male, Female 

2. female: Female, Female 

3. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke

Now, we can generate a record for stroke:

1. male: Male, Female 

2. female: Female, Female 

3. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke

Now, we can generate a record for stroke:

1. male: Male, Female 

2. female: Female, Female 

3. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke

Now, we can generate a record for stroke:

1. male: Male, Female 

2. female: Female, Female 

3. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke

Now, we can generate a record for stroke:

1. male: Male, Female 

2. female: Female, Female 

3. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke

Now, we can generate a record for stroke

Generate more records in the same format.

The example below is a CSV file that contains records for a stroke. You can generate it with the CSV program:

# create a CSV file with the above example CSV file = open("C:/path/to/example.csv", 'w') # open the CSV file with the CSV program # and save it as a file named example.csv # this file will be used to generate the records for the stroke # file. # create a file named stroke_data.csv # this file will contain the records for a stroke # file. # open the file with the CSV program # and save it as a file named stroke_data.csv # this file will contain the records for a stroke # file. # open the file with the CSV program # and save it as a file named stroke_data.csv # this file will contain the records for a stroke # file.

In this example, the data for the stroke file is stored in the file stroke_data.csv and the data for the stroke file is stored in the file stroke_data.csv .

Note: The CSV file format allows you to append fields to the end of the data.

For more information about CSV files, see the section on CSV files in this chapter.

Generate records with the CSV program

The CSV program is a program that opens a CSV file with the output as a text file. It can also be used to generate records in the same format.

To generate records in the CSV format, you use the csv command.

The csv program is available in most operating systems, including Windows, Unix, and Mac OS X.

To run the csv program, you must have the following programs installed:

A version of Microsoft Excel installed on your computer.

A version of Microsoft PowerPoint installed on your computer.

The csv program is available from the Microsoft Excel Web site.

You can also download the csv program from the following FTP sites:

If you need help with the csv program, you can contact the Microsoft Excel Web site.

For more information about the csv program, see the section on the csv program in this chapter.

Generate records with the MS Excel Web site

The MS Excel Web site is a database of records that are generated by the MS Excel software.

To run the MS Excel Web site, you must have the following programs installed:

Microsoft Excel, version 11, or later.

Microsoft PowerPoint, version 11, or later.

You can also download the MS Excel Web site from the following FTP sites:

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke prediction.
Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke  

Here are example records:
