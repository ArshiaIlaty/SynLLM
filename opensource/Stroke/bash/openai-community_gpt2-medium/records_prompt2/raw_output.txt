You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.
Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

1. gender: Patient's biological sex (Male/Female)  
2. age: Age in years (0.08-82) 
3. hypertension: High blood pressure diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes)  
4. heart_disease: Heart disease diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes) 
5. ever_married: Marriage status (Yes or No) 
6. work_type: Type of employment (Private/Self-employed/Govt_job/children/Never_worked) 
7. Residence_type: Type of residence (Urban/Rural)

10. smoking_status: Smoking history (formerly smoked/never smoked/smokes/Unknown) 
11. stroke: Stroke diagnosis (1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke)  

Here are example records:
Male, 67.0, 0, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 228.69, 36.6, formerly smoked, 1  
Female, 61.0, 0, 0, Yes, Self-employed, Rural, 202.21, 28.1, never smoked, 1

Generate more records in the same format.

For example, if you generate a new record with these features:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

you would need to generate records for each of these features:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

You can also generate a single record from the records.

For example, if you generate a record for:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

You can generate the following records:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

1. gender: Patient's biological sex (Male/Female)  

2. age: Age in years (0.08-82) 

3. hypertension: High blood pressure diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes)  

4. heart_disease: Heart disease diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes) 

5. ever_married: Marriage status (Yes or No) 

6. work_type: Type of employment (Private/Self-employed/Govt_job/children/Never_worked) 

7. Residence_type: Type of residence (Urban/Rural)  

8. avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level (55-272)  

9. bmi: Body Mass Index (10-98)  

10. smoking_status: Smoking history (formerly smoked/never smoked/smokes/Unknown) 

11. stroke: Stroke diagnosis (1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke)  

This is just an example of how you can generate a record with a variety of features.

If you have more records you can generate them with the following features:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

1. gender: Patient's biological sex (Male

Generate more records in the same format. For example, you could generate a file with a list of all patients with stroke and a file with a list of all patients with heart disease. You could also generate a file with a file with a list of all patients with hypertension and a file with a file with a file with a list of all patients with heart disease.

For example, create a file called file_solutions.xml which has the following contents:

If you are looking for a machine learning library, you should look at OpenAI, which is based on the deep learning model DeepMind. It has a very powerful library of models that can be used to generate very realistic data.

This is a very simple library that can be used to generate very realistic data.

The library can be used to generate:
