These are synthetic patient records for stroke prediction research. Each record has the following features: gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, and stroke.

The generation of these records is based on the following statistics:

1. gender: Male (49%), Female (50%)
2. age: Mean = 43.2, Std = 22.6, Range: 18.0–100.0
3. hypertension: 0 = 90%, 1 = 10%

10. smoking_status: never smoked (40%), formerly smoked (20%), smokes (15%), Unknown (25%)
11. stroke: 0 = 95%, 1 = 5%

These records can be used as training data for machine learning algorithms to develop models for stroke prediction.

To generate synthetic patient records for stroke prediction, I used the following steps:

1. Generate gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status features based on the given statistics.
2. For the stroke feature, I used the given statistics that 95% of patients will have a stroke value of 0 and 5% will have a stroke value of 1.
3. Combine all the features into a single record by adding a comma between each feature.
4. Generate 100 records by repeating steps 1-3 100 times.

The result is a dataset of 100 synthetic patient records for stroke prediction, each containing 11 features.

Each record contains the following features: gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke. 

The gender distribution is 49% female and 50% male. Age has a mean of 43.2, a standard deviation of 22.6, and a range of 18.0 to 100.0. Hypertension is present in 90% of patients with a value of 1, and heart disease is present in 5% of patients with a value of 1. Ever_married is present in 65% of patients with a value of Yes and 35% with a value of No. Work_type has the following distribution: Private (60%), Self-employed (20%), Govt_job (10%), children (5%), Never_worked (5%). Residence_type has a 50% chance of being Urban and a 50% chance of being Rural. Avg_glucose_level has a mean of 106.1, a standard deviation of 45.3, and a range of 55 to 250. BMI has a mean of 28.1, a standard deviation of 7.5, and a range of 15.0 to 60.0. Smoking_status has the following distribution: never smoked (40%), formerly smoked (20%), smokes (15%), Unknown (25%). Stroke has a 95% chance of being 0 and a 5% chance of being 1.

These records can be used to generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction research.

Instructions for generating synthetic patient records for stroke prediction:
1. Select a random number between 0 and 100 for each feature (gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke).
2. If the random number is 0, set the feature value to 0.
3. If the random number is 1, set the feature value to 1.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until you have generated 10 records.

For example, to generate a record for gender:
- Random number: 58
- Gender: Male (50% chance) or Female (50% chance)
- Gender: Male (since the random number was 58 and it was greater than 50)

Continuing with the example, the generated record would be:
Male, 67.0, 0, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 228.69, 36.6, formerly smoked, 1
