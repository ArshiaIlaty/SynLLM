You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using the following rules:

- Stroke is more likely in patients who:  
  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:

Example:
Male, 43, 1, 0, Yes, Private, Urban, 70, 21, formerly smoked, 0

Patients should be randomly assigned to one of the three groups: those who have had a stroke, those who will have a stroke, and those who will not have a stroke.

1. For each patient, generate a stroke status (1 = stroke occurred, 0 = no stroke) using the following probabilities:
   - Probability of stroke = 0.01 (1 in 100)
   - Probability of no stroke = 0.99 (99 in 100)

2. Generate a stroke_status_future variable, which indicates whether the patient will have a stroke in the future. This variable should be 1 for patients who will have a stroke and 0 for patients who will not have a stroke.

3. Generate a stroke_status_history variable, which indicates whether the patient has had a stroke in the past. This variable should be 1 for patients who have had a stroke and 0 for patients who have not had a stroke.

4. To assign the patients to the three groups, we can use a simple rule:

   - Group 1: patients with stroke_status_history = 1 and stroke_status_future = 1
   - Group 2: patients with stroke_status_history = 0 and stroke_status_future = 1
   - Group 3: patients with stroke_status_history = 0 and stroke_status_future = 0

5. Finally, save the generated data in a text file with the following format:

   gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke_status_history, stroke_status_future

6. Repeat steps 1-5 until you have generated enough data points.

7. Once you have generated the data, you can use it to train machine learning models for stroke prediction.

I understand and will follow the rules for generating realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction.

Here are the steps I will take:

1. Generate random numbers for each variable within the specified ranges and categories.
2. Check for any contradictions or unlikely combinations in the generated data.
3. Adjust the values if necessary to ensure realism.
4. Continue generating records until a sufficient number (e.g. 10,000) are produced.

Here are some example records:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
Male, 68, 1, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 65, 20, Formerly smoked, 1

Generate 1000 synthetic patient records for stroke prediction.

Once you have generated the 1000 synthetic patient records, you can export them to a CSV file or any other format you need. You can also visualize the data using a chart or graph to explore the relationships between the different variables and stroke occurrence.

Synthetic medical data generation is an important tool for researchers and healthcare professionals to study and predict diseases like stroke. By using realistic patient records, you can help improve the accuracy of stroke prediction models and ultimately save lives.
