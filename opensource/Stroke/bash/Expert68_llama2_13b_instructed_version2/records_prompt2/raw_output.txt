Generate more records in the same format. [/INST]

You can use the following data as a reference:

- Gender: Male/Female
- Age: 0.08-82 years
- Hypertension: 0=No, 1=Yes
- Heart_disease: 0=No, 1=Yes
- Ever_married: Yes/No
- Work_type: Private/Self-employed/Govt_job/children/Never_worked
- Residence_type: Urban/Rural
- Avg_glucose_level: 55-272
- BMI: 10-98
- Smoking_status: formerly smoked/never smoked/smokes/Unknown
- Stroke: 1=Stroke occurred, 0=No stroke

To generate more records, you can follow these steps:

1. Choose a gender (Male/Female) for the patient.
2. Select an age between 0.08 and 82 years.
3. Determine if the patient has hypertension (0=No, 1=Yes).
4. Find out if the patient has heart disease (0=No, 1=Yes).
5. Select the patient's marital status (Yes or No).
6. Choose the type of employment (Private/Self-employed/Govt_job/children/Never_worked).
7. Select the type of residence (Urban/Rural).
8. Generate an average glucose level between 55 and 272.
9. Determine the patient's BMI between 10 and 98.
10. Select the patient's smoking status (formerly smoked/never smoked/smokes/Unknown).
11. Decide if the patient has suffered a stroke (1=Stroke occurred, 0=No stroke).

Repeat these steps to generate more records.
