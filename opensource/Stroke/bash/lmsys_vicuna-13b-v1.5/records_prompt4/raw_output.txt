  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

Example:
male, 65, 1, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 80, 90, Smokes, 1

Note: The age range is set to 0.08 to 82 because the age of the patient in the dataset is not an integer.

Please note that the number of records you generate depends on the size of the dataset you want to create. The more records you generate, the larger the dataset will be.

The generated dataset should include:

* Stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke
* Gender: Male or Female
* Age: between 0.08 and 82
* Hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
* Heart disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
* Ever married: Yes or No
* Work type: Private, Self-employed, Govt\_job, children, or Never\_worked
* Residence type: Urban or Rural
* Avg\_glucose\_level: between 55 and 27
* BMI: between 10 and 98
* Smoking status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown

You can generate the dataset by following these steps:

1. Set the number of records you want to generate.
2. Generate a list of random numbers for each variable.
3. For each record, use the random numbers to determine the values of the variables.
4. Determine if the patient had a stroke based on the variables.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the number of records you want to generate.

Here's a Python function that generates synthetic patient records for stroke prediction:
```python
import random

def generate_patient_record(num_records):
    gender = ["Male", "Female"]
    age = random.uniform(0.08, 82)
    hypertension = random.randint(0, 1)
    heart_disease = random.randint(0, 1)
    ever_married = random.choice(["Yes", "No"])
    work_type = random.choice(["Private", "Self-employed", "Govt_job", "children", "Never_worked"])
    residence_type = random.choice(["Urban", "Rural"])
    avg_glucose_level = random.uniform(55, 27)
    bmi = random.uniform(10, 98)
    smoking_status = random.choice(["formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes", "Unknown"])
    stroke = random.randint(0, 1)
    
    return gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, residence_type, 
           avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

# Generate the number of records
num_records = 1000

# Generate the dataset
patient_records = [generate_patient_record(num_records) for _ in range(num_records)]

# Print the dataset
for record in patient_records:
    print(record)
```
This function generates a dataset of 1000 synthetic patient records for stroke prediction. You can change the `num_records` variable to generate a different number of records.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using the following rules:

- Stroke is more likely in patients who:  
  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

Example:
male, 67, 1, 1, Yes, Govt\_job, Urban, 27, 92, formerly smoked, 1

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using the following rules:

- Stroke is more likely in patients who:  
  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes

9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

Example:
Male, 65, 1, 1, Yes, Govt\_job, Urban, 80, 92, Smokes, 1

10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

For example:
Male, 65, 1, 1, Yes, Govt\_job, Urban, 135, 35, Formerly\_smoked, 0
Female, 45, 0, 0, No, Self\_employed, Rural, 100, 28, Never\_smoked, 1
Male, 72, 1, 0, Yes, Private, Urban, 120, 32, Smokes, 1
Female, 55, 0, 1, Yes, Govt\_job, Rural, 95, 30, Formerly\_smoked, 0
Male, 60, 1, 1, Yes, Self\_employed, Urban, 130, 27, Formerly\_smoked, 1
Female, 40, 0, 0, No, Children, Rural, 90, 24, Never\_smoked, 0

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using the following rules:

- Stroke is more likely in patients who:  
  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

Example:  
Male, 70, 1, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 150, 30, smokes, 1

Note: The age range and hypertension categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, a patient could be 60 years old and have hypertension.
