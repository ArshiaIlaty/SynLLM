You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.
Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

1. gender: Patient's biological sex (Male/Female)  
2. age: Age in years (0.08-82) 
3. hypertension: High blood pressure diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes)  
4. heart_disease: Heart disease diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes) 
5. ever_married: Marriage status (Yes or No) 
6. work_type: Type of employment (Private/Self-employed/Govt_job/children/Never_worked) 
7. Residence_type: Type of residence (Urban/Rural)  
8. avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level (55-272)  
9. bmi: Body Mass Index (10-98)  
10. smoking_status: Smoking history (formerly smoked/never smoked/smokes/Unknown) 
11. stroke: Stroke diagnosis (1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke)  

Here are example records:
Male, 67.0, 0, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 228.69, 36.6, formerly smoked, 1  
Female, 61.0, 0, 0, Yes, Self-employed, Rural, 202.21, 28.1, never smoked, 1  
Male, 80.0, 1, 1, Yes, Private, Rural, 105.92, 32.5, smokes, 1  
Female, 49.0, 0, 0, Yes, Self-employed, Urban, 171.23, 27.7, never smoked, 0

Female, 75.0, 0, 0, Yes, Private, Rural, 118.97, 34.9, never smoked, 1  
Male, 42.0, 0, 1, No, Private, Urban, 146.21, 24.5, formerly smoked, 0

Male, 68.0, 1, 1, No, Private, Rural, 123.33, 29.9, formerly smoked, 0  
Female, 52.0, 0, 0, No, Self-employed, Urban, 182.02, 28.4, never smoked, 0  

Please note that these records are fictional and should be used for research purposes only. The actual characteristics of a patient population with regard to stroke risk would be influenced by many factors beyond what is captured in these examples.

These records are meant to represent a variety of demographic and health-related factors that could influence the likelihood of a stroke occurrence. Each record is meant to be a realistic representation of a patient's history and characteristics, but please note that these are synthetic data and should not be used for actual patient identification or research without proper consent and context.
