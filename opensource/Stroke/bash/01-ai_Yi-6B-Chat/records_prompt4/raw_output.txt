  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using the following rules:

- Stroke is more likely in patients who:  
  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)
