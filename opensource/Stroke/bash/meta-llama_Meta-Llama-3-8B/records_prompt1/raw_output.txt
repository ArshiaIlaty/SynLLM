Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
1. gender: Male, Female

The data is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/stroke-prediction-dataset  

You can use any programming language to implement this project.  

Please submit your project as a Python or R script, or as a Jupyter notebook.  

You can use the following files to implement your project:  
stroke_prediction_dataset.csv  
stroke_prediction_dataset_clean.csv  
stroke_prediction_dataset_processed.csv  

stroke_prediction_dataset.csv is the original dataset. stroke_prediction_dataset_clean.csv is the dataset with missing values filled in and other inconsistencies fixed. stroke_prediction_dataset_processed.csv is the dataset with all the values normalized and transformed into the appropriate range.
