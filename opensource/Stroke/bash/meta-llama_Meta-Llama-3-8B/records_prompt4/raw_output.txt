You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using the following rules:

- Stroke is more likely in patients who:  
  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

You must use the following Python packages and libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn

For each patient record, you must generate random numbers that conform to the rules above. The random numbers must be generated using the following methods:
- numpy.random.choice()
- numpy.random.randint()
- numpy.random.uniform()

You must use the following Python code structure:
- Use a loop to generate each record
- Use a function to generate a random value for each field
- Use if/else statements to check if the generated value is within the allowed range
- Use a while loop to generate a new random value if the generated value is not within the allowed range
- Use a function to check if a patient has a higher risk of stroke based on the generated values
- Use a function to generate a stroke value based on the risk of stroke

You must use the following Python functions and methods:
- numpy.random.choice()
- numpy.random.randint()
- numpy.random.uniform()

  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:

In this example, the patient is a female, 63 years old, who has never smoked, and is not hypertensive or has heart disease. She is married and works privately. She lives in an urban area. Her glucose level is 96 and her BMI is 32. She has a stroke.

Use the following rules to generate your data:

1. Generate a random number from 0 to 1.
2. If the number is less than 0.2, then the patient has a stroke.
3. If the number is less than 0.4, then the patient is male.
4. If the number is less than 0.6, then the patient is between the ages of 0.08 and 60.
5. If the number is less than 0.8, then the patient has hypertension or heart disease.
6. If the number is less than 0.9, then the patient is a smoker or formerly smoked.
7. If the number is less than 0.95, then the patient has higher glucose levels or BMI.
8. If the number is less than 0.98, then the patient is married (age-correlated).
9. If the number is less than 0.99, then the patient is not married (age-correlated).
10. If the number is less than 1, then the patient is a stroke patient.

Your task is to generate new synthetic records that follow the above rules and that can be used for stroke prediction research.  
You will need to generate a dataset of 100,000 synthetic records. The first 10,000 records should be real patient records.  
The remaining 90,000 records should be synthetic records.  
You will need to use a random number generator to generate the synthetic records.  
The stroke column should be randomly generated using a random number generator.  
The age column should be randomly generated using a random number generator.  
The hypertension column should be randomly generated using a random number generator.  
The heart_disease column should be randomly generated using a random number generator.  
The ever_married column should be randomly generated using a random number generator.  
The work_type column should be randomly generated using a random number generator.  
The Residence_type column should be randomly generated using a random number generator.

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using the following rules:

- Stroke is more likely in patients who:  
  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

Make sure that your code is easy to read and understand. If you have any questions about the exercise, feel free to ask!

You must use the following code to generate your data:  
https://github.com/udacity/nd101/blob/master/project3/Code/data_generator.py

# Instructions
1. Use the following ranges and categories to generate realistic patient records for stroke prediction.
2. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
3. You must use the following code to generate your data: https://github.com/udacity/nd101/blob/master/project3/Code/data_generator.py
4. Your code should produce a CSV file of synthetic data that has at least 100,000 records and meets the following requirements:
• At least 50,000 records have stroke = 1
• At least 50,000 records have stroke = 0
• The distribution of values for each feature should be similar to the real data (for example, the average age is 43, so the average age in your synthetic data should also be close to 43)
• The data should be realistic and consistent with the rules you described
• The data should be reproducible, so that someone else can generate the same data with the same code

Write a program that generates 100,000 records with realistic values for each field, using the rules and categories above. Print the records to standard output, one per line.

You should include at least one of each gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, ever married, work type, residence type, avg glucose level, bmi, and smoking status. Make sure the values you generate are realistic. For example, if you generate a value of 100 for age, you should have a corresponding value of 1 for hypertension, and so on.
