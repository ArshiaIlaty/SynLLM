Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

1. gender: Patient's biological sex (Male/Female)  
2. age: Age in years (0.08-82) 
3. hypertension: High blood pressure diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes)

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.
Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

1. gender: Patient's biological sex (Male/Female)  
2. age: Age in years (0.08-82) 
3. hypertension: High blood pressure diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes)  
4. heart_disease: Heart disease diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes) 
5. ever_married: Marriage status (Yes or No) 
6. work_type: Type of employment (Private/Self-employed/Govt_job/children/Never_worked) 
7. Residence_type: Type of residence (Urban/Rural)  
8. avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level (55-272)  
9. bmi: Body Mass Index (10-98)  
10. smoking_status: Smoking history (formerly smoked/never smoked/smokes/Unknown) 
11. stroke: Stroke diagnosis (1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke)  

Here are example records:
Male, 67.0, 0, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 228.69, 36.6, formerly smoked, 1

Generate more records in the same format. Make sure the distribution of values for each feature matches the distribution of the training set.

For example, if the training set has 1% of records with hypertension=1, then the generated set should have about 1% of records with hypertension=1.

The training set has the following statistics:

Male: 59.6%  
Female: 40.4%  
age: mean = 57.2, std = 12.3  
hypertension: 1 = 25.6%, 0 = 74.4%  
heart_disease: 1 = 26.4%, 0 = 73.6%  
ever_married: Yes = 65.7%, No = 34.3%  
work_type: Private = 35.7%, Self-employed = 27.8%, Govt_job = 10.4%, children = 15.3%, Never_worked = 10.8%  
Residence_type: Urban = 50.9%, Rural = 49.1%  
avg_glucose_level: mean = 154.7, std = 50.3  
bmi: mean = 29.2, std = 7.2  
smoking_status: formerly smoked = 33.1%, never smoked = 52.7%, smokes = 10.1%, Unknown = 4.1%  
stroke: 1 = 19.7%, 0 = 80.3%  


This dataset has 1000 records, so your generated set should also have 1000 records.

Here are the results of the generated set:

Male: 59.6%  
Female: 40.4%  
age: mean = 57.2, std = 12.3  
hypertension: 1 = 25.6%, 0 = 74.4%

Generate more records in the same format. 

Please create a Python script that generates these records. Please do not hardcode any of these values. 
Please include your code in the github repository. 

You may use random values from the ranges shown above, or use a random seed (such as 1234) to generate the same set of records. 

Please include a README file that explains how to use the code to generate records. 

Please provide a short description of your code and how it works.
