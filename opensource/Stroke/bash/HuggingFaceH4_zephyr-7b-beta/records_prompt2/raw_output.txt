You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.
Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

1. gender: Patient's biological sex (Male/Female)  
2. age: Age in years (0.08-82) 
3. hypertension: High blood pressure diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes)  
4. heart_disease: Heart disease diagnosis (0=No, 1=Yes) 
5. ever_married: Marriage status (Yes or No) 
6. work_type: Type of employment (Private/Self-employed/Govt_job/children/Never_worked) 
7. Residence_type: Type of residence (Urban/Rural)  
8. avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level (55-272)  
9. bmi: Body Mass Index (10-98)  
10. smoking_status: Smoking history (formerly smoked/never smoked/smokes/Unknown) 
11. stroke: Stroke diagnosis (1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke)  

Here are example records:
