You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using the following rules:

- Stroke is more likely in patients who:  
  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
