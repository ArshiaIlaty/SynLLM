You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke prediction.
Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke  

Here are example records:
Male, 67.0, 0, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 228.69, 36.6, formerly smoked, 1  
Female, 61.0, 0, 0, Yes, Self-employed, Rural, 202.21, 28.1, never smoked, 1
