Human: You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.
Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using these statistics:

1. gender: Male (49%), Female (50%)  
2. age: Mean = 43.2, Std = 22.6, Range: 18.0–100.0  
3. hypertension: 0 = 90%, 1 = 10%  
4. heart_disease: 0 = 95%, 1 = 5%  
5. ever_married: Yes (65%), No (35%)  
6. work_type: Private (60%), Self-employed (20%), Govt_job (10%), children (5%), Never_worked (5%)  
7. Residence_type: Urban (50%), Rural (50%)  
8. avg_glucose_level: Mean = 106.1, Std = 45.3, Range = 55–250  
9. bmi: Mean = 28.1, Std = 7.5, Range = 15.0–60.0  
10. smoking_status: never smoked (40%), formerly smoked (20%), smokes (15%), Unknown (25%)  
11. stroke: 0 = 95%, 1 = 5%
