You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using the following rules:

- Stroke is more likely in patients who:  
  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

For example, a record might look like this:
Male, 65, 1, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 60, 27, formerly smoked, 1

This example patient record shows that the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and heart disease, who is married and works in a private job, living in an urban area, with an average glucose level of 60 and a BMI of 27. He has formerly smoked, and has had a stroke.

This is a fictional example of a patient record. Please generate 1000 realistic patient records following the given rules.

As a synthetic medical data generator, you have been tasked with creating realistic patient records for stroke prediction research. You have been provided with a set of rules to follow when generating these records.

To begin, you will need to determine the gender of each patient. Use the following ranges and categories:

* Gender: Male or Female

Next, you will need to determine the age of each patient. Use the following range:

* Age: between 0.08 and 82

You will also need to determine whether each patient has hypertension or heart disease. Use the following categories:

* Hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
* Heart disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes

You will also need to determine whether each patient is married or not. Use the following categories:

* Ever married: Yes or No

In addition, you will need to determine the type of work the patient does, as well as their residence type. Use the following categories:

* Work type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked
* Residence type: Urban or Rural

You will also need to determine the average glucose level and BMI of each patient. Use the following ranges:

* Avg glucose level: between 55 and 27
* BMI: between 10 and 98

Finally, you will need to determine whether each patient smokes or not, and whether they have had a stroke or not. Use the following categories:

* Smoking status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown
* Stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke

Using the provided rules, generate 1000 realistic patient records for stroke prediction research. Each record should be a comma-separated line in the format: gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, ever married, work type, residence type, avg glucose level, bmi, smoking status, stroke.

For example, a generated record might look like this:
Male, 75, 1, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 65, 27, formerly smoked, 1

For example:
Male, 62, 1, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 65, 27, formerly smoked, 0

Create 1000 synthetic patient records.

You will need to use the following variables to create the synthetic patient records:

• Gender: Male or Female
• Age: between 0.08 and 82
• Hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
• Heart disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
• Ever married: Yes or No
• Work type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never worked
• Residence type: Urban or Rural
• Avg glucose level: between 55 and 27
• BMI: between 10 and 98
• Smoking status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown
• Stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke

Create 1000 synthetic patient records using the above variables, and ensure that each record is a comma-separated line with the exact format specified above.

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

Note: You can use any random number generator to generate these values, or you can use a simple formula to combine the variables in a way that is similar to how a real stroke prediction model would work.

Example of a generated patient record:
Male, 62, Hypertension = 1, Heart_disease = 1, Ever_married = Yes, Work_type = Private, Residence_type = Urban, Avg_glucose_level = 62, Bmi = 27, Smoking_status = formerly smoked, Stroke = 1

This example patient record is a 62-year-old male who has hypertension and heart disease, is married, works in a private job, lives in an urban area, has an average glucose level of 62, has a BMI of 27, and has formerly smoked. The stroke column is set to 1, indicating that the patient has had a stroke.

Create 1000 synthetic patient records following these rules.

In this task, you will generate 1000 realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction research. Each record will be a comma-separated line with the following format: gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke.

To generate these records, you will use the following rules:

* Stroke is more likely in patients who:
	+ Are older (age > 60)
	+ Have hypertension or heart disease
	+ Are smokers or formerly smoked
	+ Have higher glucose levels or BMI
	+ Are married (age-correlated)
* Use the following ranges and categories:
	+ Gender: Male or Female
	+ Age: between 0.08 and 82
	+ Hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
	+ Heart disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
	+ Ever married: Yes or No
	+ Work type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never worked
	+ Residence type: Urban or Rural
	+ Avg glucose level: between 55 and 27
	+ BMI: between 10 and 98
	+ Smoking status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown
	+ Stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke

To generate these records, you can use a random number generator or a statistical simulation. You can also use existing data sources, such as electronic health records or public datasets, to generate synthetic data that follows these rules.

Once you have generated these records, you will provide them in a comma-separated list with the specified format. For example, a record could be: Male, 62, 1 = Yes, 1 = Yes, 1 = Yes, Private, Urban, 65, 27, never smoked, 1 = Stroke occurred.

Remember to follow these rules when generating the synthetic patient records, as they will be used for machine learning models to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence.

For example, a record for a patient who is a 65-year-old male, with hypertension and heart disease, who is married and has a history of smoking, would be:
Male, 65, 1, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 65, 27, smokes, 1

In this example, the patient has a higher risk of stroke due to their age, hypertension, heart disease, and smoking history.

You may generate up to 1000 records.

As a synthetic data generator, you are tasked with generating a large number of synthetic patient records for stroke prediction research. You have been provided with a set of rules and ranges/categories to use when generating these records. Your goal is to generate a large and diverse set of records that could be used to train and test machine learning models for stroke prediction.

To generate these records, you will need to use a combination of random number generation and data manipulation techniques. You may want to consider using techniques such as:

* Randomly selecting values from the given ranges and categories for each attribute
* Combining multiple attributes to create new values (e.g., randomly selecting a value from the range of ages and combining it with a randomly selected value from the range of glucose levels)
* Creating new categories or subcategories (e.g., creating a new category for "children" or "never worked")
* Randomly perturbing the data to create a diverse set of records (e.g., adding noise to the glucose levels or bmi values)

Remember to use appropriate data manipulation techniques to ensure that the generated records are realistic and follow the provided rules.

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for stroke prediction using the following rules:

- Stroke is more likely in patients who:  
  • Are older (age > 60)  
  • Have hypertension or heart disease  
  • Are smokers or formerly smoked  
  • Have higher glucose levels or BMI  
  • Are married (age-correlated)  

Use the following ranges and categories:
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke 

Use the following ranges and categories. Each record should be a comma-separated line with this exact format:
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke

For example, a record for a 65-year-old male who has hypertension and heart disease, is married, works in a private job, lives in an urban area, has average glucose levels, and is a smoker would look like this:
Male, 65, 1, 1, 1, Private, Urban, 60, 27, smokes, 1
