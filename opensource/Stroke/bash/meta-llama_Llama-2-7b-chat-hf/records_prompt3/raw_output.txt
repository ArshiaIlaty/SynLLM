These records include a range of values for each feature, with the majority of patients having hypertension, heart disease, and being married. The age range is 18 to 100, with a mean of 43.2 and a standard deviation of 22.6. The avg_glucose_level is 106.1, with a standard deviation of 45.3, and the bmi is 28.1, with a standard deviation of 7.5. The smoking status is divided into never smoked (40%), formerly smoked (20%), and smokes (15%). The stroke status is 0 for 95% of patients and 5% have a stroke.
