Generate more records in the same format.

This is a simple form of medical data generation.

You can generate a lot of records in the same format.

If you need more records, you can generate new records in the same format.

If you want to generate records with the same format as the last one, you can use the -d option to generate records in the same format as the last one.

You can also generate records using the format of the last record.
