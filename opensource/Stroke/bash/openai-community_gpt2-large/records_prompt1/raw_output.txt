You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for stroke prediction.
Each record should be a comma-separated line with these features:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
1. gender: Male, Female  
2. age: between 0.08 and 82  
3. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
4. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
5. ever_married: Yes or No  
6. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  
7. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  
8. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27  
9. bmi: between 10 and 98  
10. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  
11. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke  

Here are example records:
Male, 67.0, 0, 1, Yes, Private, Urban, 228.69, 36.6, formerly smoked, 1  
Female, 61.0, 0, 0, Yes, Self-employed, Rural, 202.21, 28.1, never smoked, 1

Generate parameters

To generate parameters for your records, open the "Parameters" tab in the Generate Records dialog.

Here is an example of the parameters that can be used to generate records:

1. age: between 0.08 and 82 (this parameter is used to generate records for younger patients)  

2. hypertension: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  

3. heart_disease: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  

4. ever_married: Yes or No  

5. work_type: Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, or Never_worked  

6. Residence_type: Urban or Rural  

7. avg_glucose_level: between 55 and 27 (this parameter is used to generate records for older patients)  

8. bmi: between 10 and 98 (this parameter is used to generate records for those with a higher BMI)  

9. smoking_status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown  

10. stroke: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke  

11. stroke_type: Type A, Type B, Type C, Type D  

12. stroke_number: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke  

13. stroke_diagnosis: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke  

14. stroke_score: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke  

15. stroke_progression: 1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke
