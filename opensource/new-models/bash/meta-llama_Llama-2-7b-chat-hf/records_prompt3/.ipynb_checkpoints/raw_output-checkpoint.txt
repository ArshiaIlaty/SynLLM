These synthetic patient records are generated using a combination of statistical techniques, including:

1. Data augmentation: This involves transforming the original data to create new records with similar statistical properties. For example, in the case of age, we generated new age values by adding or subtracting random amounts to the original values.
2. Sampling: This involves selecting random values from a known distribution to create new records. For example, we generated new values for the hypertension feature by randomly selecting from a known distribution of values.
3. Generative models: This involves using machine learning algorithms to generate new data that is similar to the original data. For example, we used a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate new patient records that are similar to the original data.

By combining these techniques, we were able to generate a large number of realistic synthetic patient records that can be used for diabetes prediction research.

The data is in a CSV format and contains 1000 records.

The data is generated using a combination of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, including:

1. Gender: Generated using a Poisson distribution with a mean of 0.48 and a standard deviation of 0.15.
2. Age: Generated using a normal distribution with a mean of 41.8 and a standard deviation of 15.2.
3. Hypertension: Generated using a Bernoulli distribution with a probability of 0.85 for no hypertension and 0.15 for yes.
4. Heart disease: Generated using a Bernoulli distribution with a probability of 0.92 for no heart disease and 0.08 for yes.
5. Smoking history: Generated using a categorical distribution with the following categories: never (60%), former (22%), current (15%), and not current (3%).
6. BMI: Generated using a normal distribution with a mean of 27.3 and a standard deviation of 6.4.
7. HbA1c level: Generated using a normal distribution with a mean of 5.7 and a standard deviation of 0.9.
8. Blood glucose level: Generated using a normal distribution with a mean of 138.0 and a standard deviation of 40.5.
9. Diabetes status: Generated using a Bernoulli distribution with a probability of 0.88 for no diabetes and 0.12 for yes.

The data is intended to be used for diabetes prediction and research, and it can be used to train machine learning models, test algorithms, or evaluate the performance of existing models.
