Please note that these records are generated synthetically and may not accurately represent real-world patient data. They are intended for research purposes only.

These records have been generated based on the provided features and their respective distributions and correlations. The generated records include information on the patient's gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status. The data are consistent with the specified distributions and correlations, and they provide a realistic representation of a diverse set of patient records for diabetes research.
