Here are some synthetic patient records generated based on the provided features and definitions:

1. Female, 42.5 years old, hypertensive, no heart disease, never smoked, BMI 27.8, HbA1c level 6.4, current blood glucose level 180 mg/dL, no diabetes.
2. Male, 57.3 years old, hypertensive and has heart disease, former smoker, BMI 31.2, HbA1c level 7.2, current blood glucose level 200 mg/dL, has diabetes.
3. Female, 41.2 years old, no hypertension, no heart disease, current smoker, BMI 29.5, HbA1c level 5.9, current blood glucose level 135 mg/dL, no diabetes.
4. Female, 24.0 years old, no hypertension, no heart disease, never smoked, BMI 22.3, HbA1c level 4.8, current blood glucose level 120 mg/dL, no diabetes.
5. Male, 61.8 years old, no hypertension, no heart disease, former smoker, BMI 34.2, HbA1c level 6.5, current blood glucose level 170 mg/dL, no diabetes.
6. Male, 12.5 years old, no hypertension, no heart disease, no smoking history, BMI 20.1, HbA1c level 5.2, current blood glucose level 110 mg/dL, no diabetes.
7. Female, 49.7 years old, hypertensive, no heart disease, current smoker, BMI 28.9, HbA1c level 6.1, current blood glucose level 160 mg/dL, no diabetes.
8. Male, 55.1 years old, hypertensive and has heart disease, never smoked, BMI 30.4, HbA1c level 7.0, current blood glucose level 190 mg/dL, has diabetes.

These records are designed to simulate a diverse range of patient profiles, including different ages, genders, health conditions, smoking histories, and BMI levels. The HbA1c and blood glucose levels are also varied to reflect different stages of diabetes management.
