These patient records are designed to mimic real-world data and can be used to train machine learning models for diabetes prediction. Each record includes a unique combination of features, including gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status.

Here are the characteristics of each feature:

1. Gender: Each record has a randomly assigned gender, with females being slightly more common than males.
2. Age: Each record has a randomly generated age between 18 and 80 years old, with a slightly right-skewed distribution.
3. Hypertension: Each record has a randomly assigned hypertension status, with 15% of records having a hypertension status of 1 (Yes) and the remaining records having a status of 0 (No).
4. Heart Disease: Each record has a randomly assigned heart disease status, with 8% of records having a heart disease status of 1 (Yes) and the remaining records having a status of 0 (No).
5. Smoking History: Each record has a randomly assigned smoking history category, with categories including never, former, current, and not current.
6. BMI: Each record has a randomly generated BMI between 15 and 60, with a right-skewed distribution.
7. HbA1c Level: Each record has a randomly generated HbA1c level between 4 and 9, with a right-skewed distribution and a strong correlation with diabetes status.
8. Blood Glucose Level: Each record has a randomly generated blood glucose level between 70 and 300, with a right-skewed distribution and a strong correlation with HbA1c level.
9. Diabetes Status: Each record has a randomly assigned diabetes status, with 12% of records having a diabetes status of 1 (Yes) and the remaining records having a status of 0 (No).

These synthetic patient records can be used to train machine learning models for diabetes prediction, and they can be modified or extended to include additional features or characteristics.
