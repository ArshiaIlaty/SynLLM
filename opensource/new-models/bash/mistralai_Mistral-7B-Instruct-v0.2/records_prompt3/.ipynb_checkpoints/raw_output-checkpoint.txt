[INST] You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with definitions and statistical metadata:

Features and Statistics:
1. gender
   - Distribution: Male: 48%, Female: 52%

2. age

   - Strong correlation with HbA1c_level

9. diabetes
   - Distribution: No (0): 88%, Yes (1): 12%
   - Correlates strongly with HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level
