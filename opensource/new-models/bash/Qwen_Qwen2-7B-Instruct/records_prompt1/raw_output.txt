```

In each record:
- **gender**: The gender of the patient (Female or Male).
- **age**: The age of the patient, ranging from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 100 years.
- **hypertension**: Indicates if the patient has hypertension (No=0, Yes=1).
- **heart_disease**: Indicates if the patient has heart disease (No=0, Yes=1).
- **smoking_history**: The patient's smoking history (never, former, current, not current).
- **bmi**: The Body Mass Index, with values between 15.0 and 60.0.
- **HbA1c_level**: The Hemoglobin A1c level, representing average blood sugar over the last three months, ranging from 4.0 to 9.0.
- **blood_glucose_level**: The current blood glucose level in mg/dL.
- **diabetes**: Indicates if the patient has diabetes (No=0, Yes=1).

These records simulate a variety of scenarios, including patients with and without diabetes, different ages, and varying levels of hypertension, heart disease, and smoking history. This diversity is crucial for comprehensive analysis in diabetes research.
