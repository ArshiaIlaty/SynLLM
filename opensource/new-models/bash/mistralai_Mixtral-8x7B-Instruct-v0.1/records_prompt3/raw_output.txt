These records are generated based on the provided feature definitions and statistical metadata. The gender distribution is roughly 50/50, age is randomly sampled from a slightly right-skewed distribution with mean 41.8 and standard deviation 15.2, and hypertension and heart disease are randomly assigned with the given distributions and correlations. Smoking history is randomly assigned from the four categories with the given proportions. BMI is randomly sampled from a right-skewed distribution with mean 27.3 and standard deviation 6.4. HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status are randomly assigned based on their strong correlations.

1. Female, 55.0, 0, 0, former, 26.1, 5.5, 125, 0
2. Male, 42.5, 1, 0, never, 30.3, 6.9, 165, 1
3. Female, 39.6, 0, 1, current, 23.6, 4.7, 110, 0
4. Male, 68.9, 1, 1, not current, 34.2, 7.6, 190, 1
5. Female, 48.7, 0, 0, never, 29.8, 5.2, 120, 0

These records are generated based on the given statistical metadata. The gender distribution is roughly 50/50, and the age is randomly sampled from a slightly right-skewed distribution with a mean of 41.8. The hypertension and heart disease variables are assigned based on the given correlations with age, hypertension, and smoking history. The smoking history variable is assigned based on the given categories. The BMI variable is randomly sampled from a right-skewed distribution with a mean of 27.3. The HbA1c level and blood glucose level are assigned based on the given correlations with diabetes status. Finally, the diabetes variable is assigned based on the given distribution and correlations with HbA1c level and blood glucose level.
