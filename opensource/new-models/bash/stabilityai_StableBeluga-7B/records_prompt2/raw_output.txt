Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with definitions:

Features:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
