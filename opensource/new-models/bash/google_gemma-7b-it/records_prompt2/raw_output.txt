5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

Here are examples of records:

Male,11.0,0,0,No Info,27.59,6.6,100,0
These records are just examples, and the data can vary greatly.

**Generate 10 synthetic patient records:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate 10 synthetic patient records
patient_records = np.random.choice([
    {"gender": np.random.choice(["Male", "Female"]),
     "age": np.random.uniform(0, 100),
     "hypertension": np.random.choice([0, 1]),
     "heart_disease": np.random.choice([0, 1]),
     "smoking_history": np.random.choice(["never", "former", "current", "not current"]),
     "bmi": np.random.uniform(15, 60),
     "HbA1c_level": np.random.uniform(4, 9),
     "blood_glucose_level": np.random.randint(70, 300),
     "diabetes": np.random.choice([0, 1])
    } for _ in range(10)
])
```

**Print the generated records:**

```python

**Desired output:** A Pandas DataFrame containing 1000 realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction.

**Additional notes:**

* The generated data will include a range of values for each feature, based on the specified ranges and distributions.
* The data will be formatted in a Pandas DataFrame, with each row representing a patient record.
* The columns of the DataFrame will be the feature names, and the values will be the corresponding features for each patient.

**Please generate the synthetic patient records.**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Seed for reproducibility
seed = 1234

# Number of records
num_records = 1000

# Generate synthetic patient records
patient_records = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0, 1000, size=num_records), columns=["id"])

# Assign gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, diabetes for each patient

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with definitions:

Features:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

Here are examples of records:
Female,45.2,1,0,never,28.5,6.2,140,0
Male,62.7,1,1,former,32.1,7.1,185,1

Male,58.0,0,0,former,36.53,5.8,160,0
Male,11.0,0,0,No Info,27.59,6.6,100,0
The data should be realistic, but not perfectly accurate. It should be able to mimic the real-world data with some randomness and variation.

**Please generate 100 synthetic patient records.**

**Output:**

```
[
  # Patient record 1
  {
    "gender": "Female",
    "age": 45.2,
    "hypertension": 1,
    "heart_disease": 0,
    "smoking_history": "never",
    "bmi": 28.5,
    "HbA1c_level": 6.2,
    "blood_glucose_level": 140,
    "diabetes": 0
  },
  # Patient record 2
  ...
]
```

**Note:**

The output should be in the format of a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a patient record. Each key-value pair in the dictionary represents a patient's attribute and its value.

**Additional Information:**

The data generated should be realistic, but not perfectly accurate. It should be able to mimic the real-world data with some randomness and variation. The generated data should be able to be used for diabetes research and modeling.
