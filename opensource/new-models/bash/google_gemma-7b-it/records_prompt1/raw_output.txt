You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction following this format:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

Here are examples of records:
Female,45.2,1,0,never,28.5,6.2,140,0
Male,62.7,1,1,former,32.1,7.1,185,1
Female,38.9,0,0,current,24.3,5.8,130,0
Female,22.0,0,0,never,25.77,4.0,145,0
Male,58.0,0,0,former,36.53,5.8,160,0
Male,11.0,0,0,No Info,27.59,6.6,100,0
 
**Please generate 10 records.**

**Note:** The generated records should be realistic and mimic the distribution of actual diabetes diagnosis in the population.

**Additional Information:**
- The data format is inspired by the MIMIC-III dataset.
- The values for each attribute are within the specified ranges.
- The records are independent and identically distributed.
- The generated records mimic the actual distribution of diabetes diagnosis in the population.

**Please generate the requested records.**

**Output:**

(10 records in the format specified above)

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction following this format:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

Here are examples of records:

# Create an array to store the records

# Gender

# Age

# Heart Disease

**Note:** This code generates records with a wide range of values to reflect the diversity of diabetes risk factors. However, it does not perfectly mimic real medical data, as it does not include all relevant factors and does not account for the complexity of diabetes diagnosis.
