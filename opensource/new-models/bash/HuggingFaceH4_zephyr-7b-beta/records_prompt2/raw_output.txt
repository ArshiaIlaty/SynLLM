Note: The HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level features are randomly generated based on the provided ranges. The diabetes feature is determined based on the HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level, following a decision tree algorithm:

- If HbA1c_level >= 6.5, then diabetes = 1
- If HbA1c_level < 6.5 and blood_glucose_level >= 200, then diabetes = 1
- Otherwise, diabetes = 0

This decision tree is based on the American Diabetes Association criteria for diabetes diagnosis.
