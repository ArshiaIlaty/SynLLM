The diabetes status is a mix of both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, with a strong correlation between diabetes status and HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level. The hypertension and heart_disease variables have a low prevalence, with most patients having neither condition. The smoking_history variable has a mix of never, former, current, and no current smokers.

1. Patient 1: Female, 52 years old, no history of hypertension or heart disease, never smoked, BMI 28.5, HbA1c_level 6.2, blood_glucose_level 140, diabetes status: 0

2. Patient 2: Male, 62.7 years old, history of hypertension and heart disease, former smoker, BMI 32.1, HbA1c_level 7.1, blood_glucose_level 185, diabetes status: 1

3. Patient 3: Female, 38.9 years old, current smoker, no history of hypertension or heart disease, BMI 24.37, HbA1c_level 5.8, blood_glucose_level 130, diabetes status: 0

4. Patient 4: Female, 22.0 years old, no history of hypertension or heart disease, never smoked, BMI 25.77, HbA1c_level 4.0, blood_glucose_level 145, diabetes status: 0

5. Patient 5: Male, 58.0 years old, former smoker, no history of hypertension, BMI 27.59, HbA1c_level 6.6, blood_glucose_level 100, diabetes status: 0

These records were generated using a statistical model that takes into account the correlations and distributions of the features provided. The model ensures that the records are realistic and reflect the given statistics. These records can be used for diabetes prediction and research purposes.

Here are some additional synthetic patient records for diabetes research based on the features and statistics provided:

1. Female, 32.3, 1, 0, never, 29.8, 6.1, 135, 0
2. Male, 70.3, 0, 1, former, 30.2, 7.0, 175, 1

5. Male, 52.1, 0, 0, former, 33.2, 6.5, 150, 0
6. Female, 55.8, 0, 0, never, 27.8, 5.5, 125, 0

9. Male, 64.7, 1, 1, former, 31.9, 7.1, 190, 1

These records have a mix of diabetes status (0 = no diabetes, 1 = diabetes) and the other features as provided. The HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level are strongly correlated with diabetes status, but there is some variation in these values for individuals without diabetes. This reflects the fact that these values can be influenced by factors such as diet, exercise, and medication, and not all individuals with high HbA1c_level or blood_glucose_level will necessarily develop diabetes. The distribution of diabetes status in these records (12% with diabetes) is consistent with the provided statistics.
