Assistant: 500 synthetic patient records have been generated, following the specified features and their statistical metadata. The records have been saved in a CSV file named "diabetes_records.csv" for easy access and analysis. The records are designed to provide realistic and diverse data for diabetes prediction research. The dataset includes information on gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, BMI, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, and diabetes status. The data is generated to reflect the specified distribution and correlations among the features. The records have been generated with a focus on providing a representative sample of the target population, while maintaining the statistical properties of the real-world dataset. The dataset is suitable for diabetes prediction research and can be used to train and validate machine learning models for predicting diabetes.
