These records are synthetic and do not correspond to real patient data. They are generated to maintain realistic correlations between features, such as a higher prevalence of hypertension and heart disease among patients with diabetes, as well as a higher BMI and HbA1c level. However, it's important to note that these correlations may not be perfect and should not be used to make clinical decisions without further validation.

These records were generated based on realistic correlations between the features. For example, patients with diabetes (diabetes = 1) are more likely to have higher HbA1c levels, blood glucose levels, and a history of hypertension or heart disease. Patients who are current or former smokers are also more likely to have higher blood glucose levels. Additionally, older patients and those with a higher BMI are more likely to have diabetes. These correlations are consistent with real-world data on diabetes.
