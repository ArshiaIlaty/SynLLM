You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.

Generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with acceptable values and their definition:

Features:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

Examples from real data:
1. Female,45.2,1,0,never,28.5,6.2,140,0
2. Male,70.0,1,1,current,30.2,8.0,210,1
3. Female,38.9,0,0,current,24.3,5.8,130,0

Generate 20 comma-separated records, one per line, maintaining realistic correlations between features.
```
Gender,Age,Hypertension,Heart Disease,Smoking History,BMI,HbA1c Level,Blood Glucose Level,Diabetes
```

**Note:** The generated records will be realistic but not identical to real data, as they are based on a limited sample of real data and do not represent the full range of possible values for each feature.
```

**Output:**

```
Gender,Age,Hypertension,Heart Disease,Smoking History,BMI,HbA1c Level,Blood Glucose Level,Diabetes
Female,43.1,0,0,former,32.1,5.9,160,0
Male,62.8,1,1,current,35.4,7.2,200,1
Female,31.2,0,0,never,26.8,6.1,120,0
...
```

**Please generate the 20 realistic patient records below:**

```
Gender,Age,Hypertension,Heart Disease,Smoking History,BMI,HbA1c Level,Blood Glucose Level,Diabetes
```
```

**Please include the generated records in the format shown above.**

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.

Generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with acceptable values and their definition:

Features:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

Examples from real data:
1. Male,70.0,1,1,current,30.2,8.0,210,1
2. Female,38.9,0,0,current,24.3,5.8,130,0
3. Female,29.4,0,0,never,23.0,5.1,110,0

Generate 20 comma-separated records, one per line, maintaining realistic correlations between features.
```

Please note that the generated data may not perfectly resemble real data due to the inherent randomness of the generation process. However, it will maintain the overall statistical properties and relationships between features as seen in real data.

**Additional Notes:**

* The generated data will include a mix of male and female patients.
* The age range will be between 0 and 100 years.
* The values for blood glucose level, HbA1c level, and BMI will be within realistic ranges.
* The presence of hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes will be randomly determined based on the patient's age, gender, and other factors.
* Smoking history will be categorized into never, former, or current.

**Please generate the 20 patient records below:**

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.

Generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with acceptable values and their definition:

Features:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

Examples from real data:
1. Male,70.0,1,1,current,30.2,8.0,210,1
2. Female,45.2,1,0,never,28.5,6.2,140,0
3. Female,38.9,0,0,current,24.3,5.8,130,0

Generate 20 comma-separated records, one per line, maintaining realistic correlations between features.
```
Male,62.3,1,1,former,42.1,7.6,220,1
Female,58.1,0,0,never,32.5,5.4,160,0
...
```

**Note:** The generated data should be realistic and statistically valid, but it is not intended to be medical advice or diagnosis.

**Please generate the 20 patient records below:**

```

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.

Generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with acceptable values and their definition:

Features:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

Examples from real data:
1. Female,38.9,0,0,current,24.3,5.8,130,0
2. Female,29.4,0,0,never,23.0,5.1,110,0
3. Female,45.2,1,0,never,28.5,6.2,140,0

Generate 20 comma-separated records, one per line, maintaining realistic correlations between features.
```
gender,age,hypertension,heart_disease,smoking_history,bmi,HbA1c_level,blood_glucose_level,diabetes
```

**Note:** The generated data will not be identical to real data, but it will mimic the statistical properties of real diabetes patient records.

**Output:**

```
gender,age,hypertension,heart_disease,smoking_history,bmi,HbA1c_level,blood_glucose_level,diabetes
Male,42.8,1,1,former,26.2,6.4,180,1

Please note that this data is synthetic and does not represent real patient medical records.

**Additional notes:**

- The generated data maintains realistic correlations between features, such as age and HbA1c level, and blood glucose level and BMI.
- The gender, smoking history, hypertension, and heart disease status are randomly assigned with appropriate probabilities.
- The blood glucose level is generated based on the patient's age, HbA1c level, and diabetes status.

**Please generate the 20 patient records below:**

```
[Patient Record 1-20]

Please generate the 20 records and ensure that the values are within the acceptable ranges and maintain realistic correlations between features.

**Note:** This data is intended for diabetes prediction research and not for medical diagnosis or treatment.

**Additional Information:**

- The generated data will include a mix of healthy and diabetic patients.
- The diabetes status is determined randomly, with a higher chance of diabetes for older patients and those with other risk factors.
- The blood glucose level is correlated with the HbA1c level and body mass index.
- Smoking history and hypertension are known risk factors for diabetes.

**Please generate the 20 patient records below:**
