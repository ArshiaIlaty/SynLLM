You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction following this format:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

Here are examples of records:

Note: The last column indicates whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

I want to generate 5000 records. How can I do that using Python?

I tried using NumPy to generate random numbers but I'm not sure how to create the format you specified. Please help!

Here is the code I have so far:
```
import numpy as np

# Generate random numbers for each column
gender = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=5000) # 0 or 1 for male or female
age = np.random.uniform(0, 100, size=5000) # years
hypertension = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=5000) # 0 or 1 for no or yes
heart_disease = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=5000) # 0 or 1 for no or yes
smoking_history = np.random.choice(['never', 'former', 'current', 'not current'], size=5000)
bmi = np.random.uniform(15, 60, size=5000) # Float between 15 and 60
HbA1c_level = np.random.uniform(4, 9, size=5000) # Float between 4 and 9
blood_glucose_level = np.random.uniform(70, 300, size=5000) # Integer between 70 and 300
diabetes = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=5000) # 0 or 1 for no or yes

# Create a list of dictionaries with the generated data
data = []
for i in range(5000):
    data.append({'gender': gender[i], 'age': age[i], 'hypertension': hypertension[i], 'heart_disease': heart_disease[i], 'smoking_history': smoking_history[i], 'bmi': bmi[i], 'HbA1c_level': HbA1c_level[i], 'blood_glucose_level': blood_glucose_level[i], 'diabetes': diabetes[i]})

# Print the list of dictionaries
print(data)
```
This code generates the random numbers for each column, but I'm not sure how to format the output into the desired format. Please help!

I need 500 patients with diabetes and 500 patients without diabetes. Please provide the data in a CSV file.

Please note that the data is fictional and for research purposes only.

Hint: You may want to consider using a combination of distributions to generate realistic data. For example, you could use a normal distribution for continuous variables like age and BMI, and a Bernoulli distribution for binary variables like smoking history and diabetes status.

Please note that the BMI values are not the same as the HbA1c values.

Please generate 1000 such records.

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction following this format:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

Here are examples of records:
Female,45.2,1,0,never,28.5,6.2,140,0

Male,11.0,0,0,No Info,27.59,6.6,100,0

I need 1000 records.

Please note that the data should be generated in a way that it should look like real patient data and should be distributed evenly across different age groups, genders, and other variables.
