Please generate 500 records.

Please note that the features are not equally distributed, and the data is imbalanced. The number of patients with diabetes is much smaller than the number of patients without diabetes.

I would like to have the same distribution of gender, age, and smoking history as the original data. However, I would like to have a different distribution of the other features to simulate a different population.

Also, I would like to have a mix of patients with and without diabetes, so that the generated data can be used for diabetes prediction.

Please let me know if you need any clarification or additional information.

Thank you.

Please note that the HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, and diabetes features are continuous features and the others are categorical.

Please generate 1000 records of realistic synthetic data for diabetes prediction.

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with definitions:

Features:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

Here are examples of records:

Male,11.0,0,0,No Info,27.59,6.6,100,0

Please generate 1000 records, with similar distribution as the example records.

Please note that, I want to generate records with similar distribution as the example records, not exactly the same.

Also, I want to generate records with different values for each feature, so that the generated records are not identical.

Is it possible to generate such records using python? If yes, then how?

Please provide the code and explanation.

Thank you!

============================================================

I have a dataset of patient records, and I want to generate synthetic records that are similar to the original dataset, but with different values for each feature. I want to use Python to generate these records.

Here are the features of the dataset:

Features:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

I want to generate 1000 synthetic records, with similar distribution as the original dataset. I want to use Python to generate these records.

Can someone please help me with this?

Thank you!
