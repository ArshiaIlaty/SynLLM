The goal is to generate a patient record that matches the distribution of the real patient records.

Note that some features are not present in all records.

### Evaluation

Evaluation is done by comparing the generated records to the real records using a chi-squared test. The chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the distributions of the two datasets. The test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the distributions of two datasets. It is a non-parametric test that does not require the data to be normally distributed.

The chi-squared test compares the observed frequencies in the two datasets to the expected frequencies based on the distributions of the two datasets. The observed frequencies are the actual frequencies of the values in the two datasets. The expected frequencies are the frequencies that would be expected if the distributions of the two datasets were the same.

The chi-squared test calculates a chi-squared statistic, which is a measure of how well the observed frequencies match the expected frequencies. If the chi-squared statistic is greater than the critical value, then the null hypothesis (that the distributions of the two datasets are the same) is rejected.

The chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the distributions of the two datasets. If the test is significant, then it indicates that there is a difference between the distributions of the two datasets.
