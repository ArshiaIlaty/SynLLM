## How to use

This is a synthetic data generator. You can generate realistic patient records for diabetes prediction.

### Generate

```python
from diabetes_data import generate

# Generate 100000 records
generate(100000)

# Generate 1000 records
generate(1000)

# Generate 1000 records with random seed 123
generate(1000, seed=123)
```

### Display

```python
from diabetes_data import display

# Display all 100000 records
display(100000)

# Display the first 10 records
display(10)

# Display the first 10 records with random seed 123
display(10, seed=123)
```

### Save

```python
from diabetes_data import save

# Save 1000 records in 'diabetes_data.csv'
save(1000, 'diabetes_data.csv')

# Save 1000 records in 'diabetes_data_1.csv'
save(1000, 'diabetes_data_1.csv', seed=123)
```

### Load

```python
from diabetes_data import load

# Load 1000 records from 'diabetes_data.csv'
load(1000, 'diabetes_data.csv')

# Load 1000 records from 'diabetes_data_1.csv'
load(1000, 'diabetes_data_1.csv', seed=123)
```

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with definitions and statistical metadata:

Features and Statistics:
1. gender
   - Distribution: Male: 48%, Female: 52%

2. age
   - Mean: 41.8, Std: 15.2
   - Range: 18.0-80.0
   - Distribution: Slightly right-skewed

3. hypertension
   - Distribution: No (0): 85%, Yes (1): 15%
   - Correlates with age and BMI

4. heart_disease
   - Distribution: No (0): 92%, Yes (1): 8%
   - Correlates with age and hypertension

5. smoking_history
   - Categories: never (60%), former (22%), current (15%), not current (3%)

6. bmi
   - Mean: 27.3, Std: 6.4
   - Range: 15.0-60.0
   - Distribution: Right-skewed

7. HbA1c_level
   - Mean: 5.7, Std: 0.9
   - Range: 4.0-9.0
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with diabetes status

8. blood_glucose_level
   - Mean: 138.0, Std: 40.5
   - Range: 70-300
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with HbA1c_level

9. diabetes
   - Distribution: No (0): 88%, Yes (1): 12%
   - Correlates strongly with HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level
