The dataset is a subset of [this dataset](https://github.com/jessicatao/diabetes_dataset).

# Requirements

* Python 3
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib

# Usage

```
python generate.py
```

# Generating realistic patient records

## 1. Create a new directory for your work

```
mkdir work
cd work
```

## 2. Download the dataset

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessicatao/diabetes_dataset/master/diabetes.csv -P work
```

## 3. Import the dataset into pandas

```
import pandas as pd
diabetes = pd.read_csv('diabetes.csv')
```

## 4. Generate synthetic patient records

```
import synthetic_data as sdg
records = sdg.generate(diabetes)
```

## 5. Save the synthetic patient records to a new file

```
records.to_csv('work/diabetes_synthetic.csv', index=False)
```

## 6. Visualize the synthetic patient records

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(records['age'], records['diabetes'])
plt.show()
```

![](diabetes_synthetic.png)

# Generating synthetic patient records with additional features

## 1. Add features to the dataset

```
diabetes['gender'] = diabetes.iloc[:, 0]
diabetes['heart_disease'] = diabetes.iloc[:, 1]
diabetes['smoking_history'] = diabetes.iloc[:, 2]
diabetes['bmi'] = diabetes.iloc[:, 3]
diabetes['HbA1c_level'] = diabetes.iloc[:, 4]
diabetes['blood_glucose_level'] = diabetes.iloc[:, 5]
```

## 2. Generate synthetic patient records with additional features

```
records = sdg.generate(diabetes, ['gender', 'heart_disease', 'smoking_history', 'bmi', 'HbA1c_level', 'blood_glucose_level'])
```

## 3. Save the synthetic patient records to a new file

```
records.to_csv('work/diabetes_synthetic_with_additional_features.csv', index=False)
```

## 4. Visualize the synthetic patient records

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(records['age'], records['diabetes'])
plt.show()
```
