Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with definitions:

Features:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

Here are examples of records:
Female,45.2,1,0,never,28.5,6.2,140,0

Sure, here are some realistic synthetic patient records based on the provided features and definitions:

1. Female, 45.2 years old, with hypertension (1) but no heart disease (0), has never smoked, has a BMI of 28.5, an HbA1c level of 6.2%, a blood glucose level of 140 mg/dL, and does not have diabetes (0).
2. Male, 62.7 years old, with hypertension (1) and heart disease (1), was a former smoker, has a BMI of 32.1, an HbA1c level of 7.1%, a blood glucose level of 185 mg/dL, and has diabetes (1).
3. Female, 38.9 years old, without hypertension (0) or heart disease (0), is currently smoking, has a BMI of 24.3, an HbA1c level of 5.8%, a blood glucose level of 130 mg/dL, and does not have diabetes (0).
4. Female, 22.0 years old, without hypertension (0) or heart disease (0), has never smoked, has a BMI of 25.77, an HbA1c level of 4.0%, a blood glucose level of 145 mg/dL, and does not have diabetes (0).
5. Male, 58.0 years old, without hypertension (0) or heart disease (0), was a former smoker, has a BMI of 36.53, an HbA1c level of 5.8%, a blood glucose level of 160 mg/dL, and does not have diabetes (0).
6. Male, 11.0 years old, without hypertension (0) or heart disease (0), no information available about smoking status, has a BMI of 27.59, an HbA1c level of 6.6%, a blood glucose level of 100 mg/dL, and does not have diabetes (0).

These records represent a diverse range of patient profiles, including different ages, genders, smoking histories, and health conditions, providing a comprehensive dataset for diabetes prediction research.
