   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with HbA1c_level

9. diabetes
   - Distribution: No (0): 88%, Yes (1): 12%
   - Correlates strongly with HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level

Important correlations to maintain:
1. Higher age correlates with increased hypertension and heart disease risk
2. Higher BMI correlates with increased diabetes risk
3. HbA1c_level strongly correlates with diabetes status
4. blood_glucose_level correlates with HbA1c_level and diabetes status
5. Hypertension and heart_disease are more common in older ages

Now generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records following the above feature definitions and correlations.
Each record must be a comma-separated line in this exact order:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, diabetes, diabetes_risk

This feature will generate 10 records per session. The records must be generated in the same format as the patient records. For example, if you want to generate 10 records per day, you would type:

import jupyter notebook = jupyter.notebook('synthetic_record_generator') notebook.add_output_to_file('synthetic_record_generator.csv') notebook.write_output(synthetic_record_generator.csv) notebook.save()

To save the generated record files to a file, simply run:

jupyter notebook.save()

Note:

The output file format is named with the name of the output file, rather than a .csv file name.

For example, you would see:

If you want to create multiple records, create a new file named "hb_record" and name it "hb_record_n.csv".

Create the "hb_record" file:

$ open hb_record_n.csv

Then, in the "file" menu, select "Generate".

You can also use "File -> Save" to save the generated file to a file.

Now, to generate a new record, select "Generate" in the "File menu, select "Generate" in the "File menu, and "Browse" to the "hb_record" file.

If you want to generate the new record using the "hb_record" file, you will need to set the file size to 100Kb.

You can generate all of the records in this example as well as the "hb_record" file.

Now, select "Save" and hit "Generate" to create the new record.

If you want to generate all of the records in the example above, select "Save" and hit "Generate" to create the new record.

If you want to generate the records in the example above, select "Save" and hit "Generate" to create the new record.

Now, you can use the "Generate" dialog box to generate the records.

Here is the output:

filename.csv

2. Export the resulting data to the following file, named data.csv.

data.csv

3. Save the data file to your computer.

The file is ready for use in your own applications.

5. Create your own custom files and generate your own custom data.

6. Open your own application and create a custom application that uses the custom data.

7. Run the custom application to generate records from the data.csv file.

You can also generate medical records from synthetic data by adding missing data to the database. This is called "missing data" and it's a good practice to have a good backup of your data.

As a reminder, a good backup is a good backup.

This example uses the same set of features as the previous example, but with more advanced features.

The next step is to add missing data to the database.

Here is the generated database:

CREATE DATABASE diabetic_record_feature ( gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, missing_data);

The missing data is an array of features with metadata.

Here is a sample feature definition:

DATABASE diabetic_record_feature ( gender, age, hypertension, missing_data);

Here is the data generated from the feature definition:
