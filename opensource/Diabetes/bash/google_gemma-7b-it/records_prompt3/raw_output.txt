**Additional Notes:**

- The data generated is synthetic and does not represent real patient information.
- The data includes features such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status.
- The data is right-skewed, meaning that the data values tend to cluster towards the lower end of the range, with a few outliers at the higher end.
- The data correlates with real-world diabetes risk factors and can be used to develop diabetes prediction models.
