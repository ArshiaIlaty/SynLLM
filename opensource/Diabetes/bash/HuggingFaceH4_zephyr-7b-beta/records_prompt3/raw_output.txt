These records follow the same statistical metadata as the initial records, with the exception of a few outliers in age, BMI, and HbA1c_level. The gender distribution is also slightly different, with a slightly higher proportion of males (52%). The records include a mix of patients with and without diabetes, as well as those with and without comorbidities such as hypertension and heart disease. The records also include smoking history, which may impact diabetes risk. The blood glucose and HbA1c_level measurements vary widely, reflecting the range of diabetes severity and management.

   - Distribution: Slightly right-skewed

3. hypertension
   - Distribution: No (0): 85%, Yes (1): 15%
   - Correlates with age and BMI

4. heart_disease
   - Distribution: No (0): 92%, Yes (1): 8%
   - Correlates with age and hypertension

7. HbA1c_level
   - Mean: 5.7, Std: 0.9
   - Range: 4.0-9.0
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with diabetes status

8. blood_glucose_level
   - Mean: 138.0, Std: 40.5
   - Range: 70-300
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with HbA1c_level

9. diabetes
   - Distribution: No (0): 88%, Yes (1): 12%
   - Correlates strongly with HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level

Here are some more synthetic patient records based on the given features and statistics:

2. Male, 32.4, 0, 0, former, 26.2, 5.6, 110, 0

9. Female, 34.6, 0, 1, current, 29.6, 6.2, 115, 1

These records demonstrate the correlations between the features and the diabetes status. For example, patients with hypertension (feature 4) or smoking history (feature 6) are more likely to have diabetes (feature 9). Patients with higher HbA1c_level (feature 8) and blood_glucose_level (feature 7) are also more likely to have diabetes. The synthetic patient records generated based on these features and statistics can be used for diabetes prediction and research.
