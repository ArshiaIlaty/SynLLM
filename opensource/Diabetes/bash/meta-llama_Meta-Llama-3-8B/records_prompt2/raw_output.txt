You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.

Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with definitions:

Features:
1. gender: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
2. age: Patient's age in years (Float: 0.0-100.0)
3. hypertension: Whether patient has hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
4. heart_disease: Whether patient has heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
5. smoking_history: Patient's smoking history (never/former/current/not current)
6. bmi: Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on weight and height (Float: 15.0-60.0)
7. HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, measure of average blood sugar over past 3 months (Float: 4.0-9.0)
8. blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level in mg/dL (Integer: 70-300)
9. diabetes: Whether patient has diabetes (0: No, 1: Yes)

Here are examples of records:
Female,45.2,1,0,never,28.5,6.2,140,0
Male,62.7,1,1,former,32.1,7.1,185,1
Female,38.9,0,0,current,24.3,5.8,130,0
Female,22.0,0,0,never,25.77,4.0,145,0
Male,58.0,0,0,former,36.53,5.8,160,0
Male,11.0,0,0,No Info,27.59,6.6,100,0
Female,42.5,0,0,former,25.8,5.9,150,0
Female,27.3,1,0,never,25.2,5.8,120,0
Male,39.8,1,0,former,30.2,6.3,160,0

The task is to generate realistic records for each feature using appropriate distributions. For example, the gender feature can be generated using a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds to male and 1 corresponds to female. The age feature can be generated using a normal distribution with mean 45 and standard deviation 10. The hypertension feature can be generated using a Bernoulli distribution with parameter 0.3. The heart disease feature can be generated using a Bernoulli distribution with parameter 0.2. The smoking history feature can be generated using a categorical distribution with three categories (never/former/current/not current) and probabilities (0.5/0.2/0.2/0.1). The BMI feature can be generated using a normal distribution with mean 25 and standard deviation 5. The HbA1c level feature can be generated using a normal distribution with mean 5.5 and standard deviation 1. The blood glucose level feature can be generated using a normal distribution with mean 120 and standard deviation 20. The diabetes feature can be generated using a Bernoulli distribution with parameter 0.1.

The generated records should be stored in a CSV file with each row representing a patient record. The columns should be labeled with the feature names. The records should be generated using the appropriate distributions for each feature. The generated records should be realistic and representative of real patient data.
