   - Correlates with age and BMI

4. heart_disease
   - Distribution: No (0): 92%, Yes (1): 8%
   - Correlates with age and hypertension

5. smoking_history
   - Categories: never (60%), former (22%), current (15%), not current (3%)

6. bmi
   - Mean: 27.3, Std: 6.4 
   - Range: 15.0-60.0
   - Distribution: Right-skewed

7. HbA1c_level
   - Mean: 5.7, Std: 0.9
   - Range: 4.0-9.0
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with diabetes status

8. blood_glucose_level
   - Mean: 138.0, Std: 40.5
   - Range: 70-300
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with HbA1c_level

9. diabetes
   - Distribution: No (0): 88%, Yes (1): 12%
   - Correlates strongly with HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level

Important correlations to maintain:
1. Higher age correlates with increased hypertension and heart disease risk
2. Higher BMI correlates with increased diabetes risk
3. HbA1c_level strongly correlates with diabetes status
4. blood_glucose_level correlates with HbA1c_level and diabetes status
5. Hypertension and heart_disease are more common in older ages

Now generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records following the above feature definitions and correlations.
Each record must be a comma-separated line in this exact order:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, diabetes

Each record must be 100% accurate, and you must use the above statistics and correlations to generate each record.

4. blood_glucose_level correlates with HbA1c_level and diabetes status
5. Hypertension and heart_disease are more common in older ages

Now generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records following the above feature definitions and correlations.
Each record must be a comma-separated line in this exact order:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, diabetes

For example, the first record might be:

Female, 45, 1, 1, former, 30, 7.2, 145, 1

Note: the correlation between HbA1c_level and diabetes status means that you must maintain the HbA1c_level within a reasonable range of values for each diabetes status. For example, if you generate a patient with diabetes status 1, then the HbA1c_level must be between 6.0 and 9.0. If you generate a patient with diabetes status 0, then the HbA1c_level must be between 4.0 and 6.0.

Male, 60, 1, 1, never, 30.0, 6.5, 180.0, 1

For this assignment, you can ignore the smoking history. Just randomly assign smoking_history as never, former, current, or not current for each record.

Output the 20 records in a file named records.txt.

Hint: You can use numpy to generate random numbers following a normal distribution.

You may use Python or R or any other programming language you like. You can use any library or function you like. You are encouraged to use any publicly available synthetic data generation library if you like, but you must provide the exact command you used to generate the data. The data must be generated with a random seed, and you must provide the seed you used. The seed must be a positive integer.

You must provide a brief description of your data generation process, including the libraries you used, the command you ran to generate the data, the random seed you used, and the correlation you maintained between the features. You can use this template to provide the description.

You must provide a brief description of your data generation process, including the libraries you used, the command you ran to generate the data, the random seed you used, and the correlation you maintained between the features. You can use this template to provide the description.

You must also provide a brief description of how you generated the data. For example, you can use this template:

I used the random library to generate the data. I used the seed 12345 to generate the data. I used the following code to generate the data:

import random

random.seed(12345)

print(random.randint(0, 1))
print(random.randint(0, 1))
print(random.randint(0, 1))
print(random.randint(0, 1))
print(random.randint(0, 1))
print(random.randint(0, 1))
print(random.randint(0, 1))
print(random.randint(0, 1))
print(random.randint(0, 1))

The correlation between the features is as follows:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, diabetes

1. Higher age correlates with increased hypertension and heart disease risk
2. Higher BMI correlates with increased diabetes risk
3. HbA1c_level strongly correlates with diabetes status

Then, write a short report (a few paragraphs) describing how you generated the synthetic patient records and any interesting patterns you noticed. For example, did you find any age groups with higher or lower rates of hypertension or heart disease? What about BMI and diabetes risk?

Note: This is a synthetic data generator, so you will need to write code to generate the data. You don't need to use any existing datasets or libraries. However, you can use statistics and correlations from existing datasets to inform your generation process.

   - Correlates with age and hypertension

5. smoking_history
   - Categories: never (60%), former (22%), current (15%), not current (3%)

2. Higher BMI correlates with increased diabetes risk
3. HbA1c_level strongly correlates with diabetes status
4. blood_glucose_level correlates with HbA1c_level and diabetes status
5. Hypertension and heart_disease are more common in older ages

Now generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records following the above feature definitions and correlations.
Each record must be a comma-separated line in this exact order:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, diabetes

You can generate the records using the following functions:
- generate_gender()
- generate_age()
- generate_hypertension()
- generate_heart_disease()
- generate_smoking_history()
- generate_bmi()
- generate_HbA1c_level()
