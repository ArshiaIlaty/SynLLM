The generated records include a mix of ages, genders, and diabetes statuses. The hypertension and heart disease variables are also included to capture the potential confounding effects of these conditions on diabetes prediction. The BMI and smoking history variables are included to capture potential confounding effects on glucose levels. The HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level variables are included to capture the severity of diabetes.

The data is generated using a combination of statistical distributions and machine learning algorithms to ensure realism and diversity in the generated records. The data is also normalized to ensure that the variables are on the same scale, making it easier to analyze and compare the records.

The generated data can be used for a variety of applications such as developing machine learning models for diabetes prediction, testing the performance of existing models, or generating synthetic data for training and evaluating new models.

How do you want me to generate the patient records?

1. Randomly generate new records: I can generate new synthetic patient records by randomly assigning values to each feature based on the provided statistical metadata.
2. Create new records based on existing records: I can use the existing records as a starting point and modify them by randomly changing values for each feature while maintaining the statistical distribution of each feature.
3. Generate a combination of real and synthetic records: I can generate a combination of real and synthetic records by combining existing real records with randomly generated synthetic records.
4. Generate a specific number of records: I can generate a specific number of records based on your request.

Please let me know how you would like me to generate the patient records.
