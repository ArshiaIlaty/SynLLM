You can also generate a file with your synthetic patient records in a CSV format.

To generate a file with your synthetic patient records, simply choose a name from the dropdown menu and choose "File" > "Create file" from the dropdown menu.

You can also generate a file in a text file, which is also stored in the same directory as your synthetic patient records.

The text file will contain the same fields as the synthetic patient records, except it will not include the HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level fields.

Please note that the text file is saved as a text file, not a CSV.

Note that you can also select a name from the dropdown menu to include the HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level fields in the text file.

The text file can be read by any text editor, including Microsoft Word.

If you have not previously created a synthetic patient record, you will need to create a new synthetic patient record before you can generate your synthetic patient records.

If you create a new synthetic patient record, you can choose from a list of synthetic patient records to use for your synthetic patient record.

You can create a synthetic patient record in two ways:

1. Creating a new synthetic patient record from the dropdown menu

2. Generating synthetic patient records from a text file

Each record must be a comma-separated line in this exact order:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, diabetes_level

The generated records must be in a format that can be read by your machine.

The generated records can be saved in a text file and read by your machine.

This method is very flexible and can be easily used for any type of data.

This method can be used for:

Diabetes research

Disease prediction

Statistical analysis

The generated records can also be used for any type of data storage.

You can find a sample dataset here.

Creating the Synthetic Patient Record

Now you have created the synthetic patient record. You can create it in one of two ways:

1. Using the command line:

python synthetic_patient_record.py <input file>

2. Using a GUI:

python synthetic_patient_record.py <input file> --help

The command line is the easiest and the most flexible way.

The GUI will take you through the process of creating the synthetic record.

Please note that the GUI can be used to create synthetic records for people with multiple diabetes risk factors. Please note that this is not a recommendation for people with diabetes.

Generating the Synthetic Patient Record:

1. Generate the synthetic patient record by using the command line:

python synthetic_patient_record.py <input file> --data-dir <dir name>

2. Generate the synthetic patient record by using the GUI:

python synthetic_patient_record.py <input file> --data-dir <dir name> --help

3. Create a synthetic record by using the GUI:

python synthetic_patient_record.py <input file> --data-dir <dir name> --name <name>

4. Create a synthetic record by using the command line:

python synthetic_patient_record.py <input file> --data-dir <dir name> --name <name> --data-dir <dir name> --name <name> --data-dir <dir name> --name <name> --data-dir <dir name> --name <name> --data-dir <dir name> --name <name> --data-dir <dir name> --name <name> --data-dir <dir name> --name <name> --data-dir <dir name> --name

   - Range: 4.0-9.0
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with diabetes status

8. blood_glucose_level
   - Mean: 138.0, Std: 40.5
   - Range: 70-300
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with HbA1c_level

9. diabetes
   - Distribution: No (0): 88%, Yes (1): 12%
   - Correlates strongly with HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level

Important correlations to maintain:
1. Higher age correlates with increased hypertension and heart disease risk
2. Higher BMI correlates with increased diabetes risk
3. HbA1c_level strongly correlates with diabetes status
4. blood_glucose_level correlates with HbA1c_level and diabetes status
5. Hypertension and heart_disease are more common in older ages

Now generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records following the above feature definitions and correlations.
Each record must be a comma-separated line in this exact order:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, diabetes, diabetes_disease, BMI, diabetes_disease_disease, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level_disease, diabetes_disease_disease_disease_disease, BMI_disease_disease, diabetes_disease_disease, hypertension, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level_disease, diabetes_disease_disease_disease, hypertension_disease_disease_disease, hypertension_disease_disease_disease, BMI_disease_disease, diabetes_disease_disease_disease_disease, hypertension_disease_disease_disease, hypertension_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease, BMI_disease_disease_disease, diabetes_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease, hypertension_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease, hypertension_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease, BMI_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease, hypertension_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease, hypertension_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease, hypertension_disease_disease_disease_disease_disease
