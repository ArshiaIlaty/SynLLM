[INST] You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.
Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with definitions and statistical metadata:

Features and Statistics:
1. gender
   - Distribution: Male: 48%, Female: 52%

2. age
   - Mean: 41.8, Std: 15.2
   - Range: 18.0-80.0
   - Distribution: Slightly right-skewed

3. hypertension
   - Distribution: No (0): 85%, Yes (1): 15%
   - Correlates with age and BMI

4. heart_disease
   - Distribution: No (0): 92%, Yes (1): 8%
   - Correlates with age and hypertension

5. smoking_history
   - Categories: never (60%), former (22%), current (15%), not current (3%)

6. bmi
   - Mean: 27.3, Std: 6.4 
   - Range: 15.0-60.0
   - Distribution: Right-skewed

7. HbA1c_level
   - Mean: 5.7, Std: 0.9
   - Range: 4.0-9.0
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with diabetes status

8. blood_glucose_level
   - Mean: 138.0, Std: 40.5
   - Range: 70-300
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with HbA1c_level

9. diabetes
   - Distribution: No (0): 88%, Yes (1): 12%
   - Correlates strongly with HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level

Important correlations to maintain:
1. Higher age correlates with increased hypertension and heart disease risk
2. Higher BMI correlates with increased diabetes risk
3. HbA1c_level strongly correlates with diabetes status
4. blood_glucose_level correlates with HbA1c_level and diabetes status
5. Hypertension and heart_disease are more common in older ages

Now generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records following the above feature definitions and correlations.
Each record must be a comma-separated line in this exact order:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, diabetes [/INST]

To generate the synthetic patient records, you can use the following script:

```python
import random

def generate_patient_record(**kwargs):
    gender = 'male' if random.random() < 0.5 else 'female'
    age = random.randint(18, 80)
    hypertension = '1' if random.random() < 0.8 else '0'
    heart_disease = '1' if random.random() < 0.2 else '0'
    smoking_history = 'never' if random.random() < 0.6 else 'current'
    bmi = random.gauss(27.3, 6.4)
    HbA1c_level = random.gauss(5.7, 0.9)
    blood_glucose_level = random.gauss(138.0, 40.5)
    diabetes = '1' if HbA1c_level > 6.5 else '0'

    return ','.join([gender, str(age), hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, str(bmi), str(HbA1c_level), str(blood_glucose_level), diabetes])

records = [generate_patient_record() for _ in range(20)]
print('\n'.join(records))
```

This script will generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. You can adjust the parameters in the `generate_patient_record()` function to change the distributions and correlations of the features.

   - Distribution: Right-skewed

7. HbA1c_level
   - Mean: 5.7, Std: 0.9
   - Range: 4.0-9.0
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with diabetes status

8. blood_glucose_level
   - Mean: 138.0, Std: 40.5
   - Range: 70-300
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with HbA1c_level

9. diabetes
   - Distribution: No (0): 88%, Yes (1): 12%
   - Correlates strongly with HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level

Important correlations to maintain:
1. Higher age correlates with increased hypertension and heart disease risk
2. Higher BMI correlates with increased diabetes risk
3. HbA1c_level strongly correlates with diabetes status
4. blood_glucose_level correlates with HbA1c_level and diabetes status
5. Hypertension and heart_disease are more common in older ages

Now generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records following the above feature definitions and correlations.
Each record must be a comma-separated line in this exact order:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, diabetes [/INST]

[INST] You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.
Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with definitions and statistical metadata:

Features and Statistics:
1. gender
   - Distribution: Male: 48%, Female: 52%

2. age
   - Mean: 41.8, Std: 15.2
   - Range: 18.0-80.0
   - Distribution: Slightly right-skewed

3. hypertension
   - Distribution: No (0): 85%, Yes (1): 15%
   - Correlates with age and BMI

4. heart_disease
   - Distribution: No (0): 92%, Yes (1): 8%
   - Correlates with age and hypertension

5. smoking_history
   - Categories: never (60%), former (22%), current (15%), not current (3%)

6. bmi
   - Mean: 27.3, Std: 6.4 
   - Range: 15.0-60.0
   - Distribution: Right-skewed

7. HbA1c_level
   - Mean: 5.7, Std: 0.9
