These synthetic patient records are generated to aid in diabetes prediction and research. The records include features such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status. These features are generated according to statistical distributions and correlations based on real-world data. The records are intended to be realistic and representative of patient populations, while also being sufficiently different from real patient data to protect privacy.

The data is generated using the following steps:

1. Gender is generated from a normal distribution with a mean of 50% (male) and a standard deviation of 10%.
2. Age is generated from a normal distribution with a mean of 40 years and a standard deviation of 15 years.
3. Hypertension is generated from a Bernoulli distribution with a probability of 0.15 (15%).
4. Heart disease is generated from a Bernoulli distribution with a probability of 0.08 (8%).
5. Smoking history is generated from a categorical distribution with the following probabilities: never (60%), former (22%), current (15%), not current (3%).
6. BMI is generated from a normal distribution with a mean of 27.3 and a standard deviation of 6.4.
7. HbA1c level is generated from a normal distribution with a mean of 5.7 and a standard deviation of 0.9.
8. Blood glucose level is generated from a normal distribution with a mean of 138 and a standard deviation of 40.5.
9. Diabetes status is generated from a Bernoulli distribution with a probability of 0.88 (88%) for no diabetes and a probability of 0.12 (12%) for diabetes.

This data generation process ensures that the features are realistic and have the correct statistical properties for use in diabetes prediction research.
