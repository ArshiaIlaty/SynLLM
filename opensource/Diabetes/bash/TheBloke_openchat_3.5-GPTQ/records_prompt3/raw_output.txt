Please note that these records are generated synthetically, and the values are within the specified ranges and follow the provided correlations. However, they are for research purposes only and should not be used for diagnosis or treatment of real patients.

Feature values are rounded to two decimal places. For example, instead of 4.0, we use 3.9.

For each feature, the values are generated based on the given distribution and correlations. For example, for gender, we have 48% male and 52% female. For HbA1c_level, we have a mean of 5.7 and a standard deviation of 0.9. The ranges for each feature are also provided.

The records are generated randomly, but they are consistent with the given distributions and correlations. For example, the probability of having hypertension is 15%, and the probability of having heart disease is 8%. The smoking history categories are also consistent with the given percentages.

The records are generated based on the given features and their correlations. For example, HbA1c_level is strongly correlated with diabetes status, so we generate values that are consistent with this correlation.

The records are generated in a way that respects the correlations between features. For example, if a patient has hypertension, the probability of having heart disease is higher.
