GPT4 System: You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for diabetes research.
Human: Generate realistic synthetic patient records for diabetes prediction. Here are the features with definitions and statistical metadata:

Features and Statistics:
1. gender
   - Distribution: Male: 48%, Female: 52%

2. age
   - Mean: 41.8, Std: 15.2
   - Range: 18.0-80.0
   - Distribution: Slightly right-skewed

3. hypertension
   - Distribution: No (0): 85%, Yes (1): 15%
   - Correlates with age and BMI

4. heart_disease
   - Distribution: No (0): 92%, Yes (1): 8%
   - Correlates with age and hypertension

5. smoking_history
   - Categories: never (60%), former (22%), current (15%), not current (3%)

6. bmi
   - Mean: 27.3, Std: 6.4 
   - Range: 15.0-60.0
   - Distribution: Right-skewed

7. HbA1c_level
   - Mean: 5.7, Std: 0.9
   - Range: 4.0-9.0
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with diabetes status

8. blood_glucose_level
   - Mean: 138.0, Std: 40.5
   - Range: 70-300
   - Distribution: Right-skewed
   - Strong correlation with HbA1c_level

9. diabetes
   - Distribution: No (0): 88%, Yes (1): 12%
   - Correlates strongly with HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level

Important correlations to maintain:
1. Higher age correlates with increased hypertension and heart disease risk
2. Higher BMI correlates with increased diabetes risk
3. HbA1c_level strongly correlates with diabetes status
4. blood_glucose_level correlates with HbA1c_level and diabetes status
5. Hypertension and heart_disease are more common in older ages

Now generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records following the above feature definitions and correlations.
Each record must be a comma-separated line in this exact order:

gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, diabetes

These records follow the given feature definitions and correlations. The records contain a mix of genders, ages, and health conditions, as well as a range of BMIs, HbA1c_levels, and blood glucose levels. The diabetes status is determined by the correlations with other features.

Important correlations to maintain:
1. Higher age correlates with increased hypertension and heart disease risk
2. Higher BMI correlates with increased diabetes risk
3. HbA1c_level strongly correlates with diabetes status
4. blood_glucose_level correlates with HbA1c_level and diabetes status
5. Hypertension and heart_disease are more common in older ages

Now generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records following the above feature definitions and correlations.
Each record must be a comma-separated line in this exact order:

   - Correlates strongly with HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level

Important correlations to maintain:
1. Higher age correlates with increased hypertension and heart disease risk
2. Higher BMI correlates with increased diabetes risk
3. HbA1c_level strongly correlates with diabetes status
4. blood_glucose_level correlates with HbA1c_level and diabetes status
5. Hypertension and heart_disease are more common in older ages

Now generate 20 realistic synthetic patient records following the above feature definitions and correlations.
Each record must be a comma-separated line in this exact order:
