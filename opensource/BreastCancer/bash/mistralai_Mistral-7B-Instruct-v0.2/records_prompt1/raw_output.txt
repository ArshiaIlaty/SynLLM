These records represent five synthetic patients with various attributes, including gender, age, hypertension status, heart disease status, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status. Some patients have risk factors for diabetes, such as hypertension or a family history of smoking, while others do not. The HbA1c and blood glucose levels provide insight into each patient's current and past blood sugar control, respectively.
