In each record, the values for the features are generated randomly within their defined ranges, while maintaining the correct relationships between the features (e.g. A higher HbA1c_level indicates a higher likelihood of diabetes). The resulting records should provide a realistic distribution of diabetes risk factors, allowing for accurate diabetes prediction models to be trained on the generated data.

Diabetes prediction:
1. High risk
2. Low risk
3. Low risk
4. High risk
5. Low risk
6. Low risk
7. High risk
8. Low risk
9. Low risk
10. High risk

The diabetes prediction is calculated based on factors such as age, BMI, smoking history, and blood glucose level. A higher risk is indicated by a value closer to 1, while a lower risk is indicated by a value closer to 0. These synthetic patient records can be used for research and development of diabetes prediction models.

Note: The BMI and blood glucose levels are randomly generated within their respective ranges, while the HbA1c_level and diabetes status are determined based on the patient's age, gender, and other features. The hypertension and heart_disease features are also randomly generated with probabilities based on real-world statistics. The smoking_history feature is randomly generated based on the patient's age, with younger patients less likely to have a history of smoking.
