You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic synthetic patient records for cirrhosis prediction.

Each record must follow this format:
ID, N_Days, Status, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage

Here are some example records:
1, 400, D, D-penicillamine, 21464, F, Y, Y, Y, Y, 14.5, 261.0, 2.60, 156.0, 1718.0, 137.95, 172.0, 190.0, 12.2, 4.0  
2, 4500, C, D-penicillamine, 20617, F, N, Y, Y, N, 1.1, 302.0, 4.14, 54.0, 7394.8, 113.52, 88.0, 221.0, 10.6, 3.0  
3, 1012, D, D-penicillamine, 25594, M, N, N, N, S, 1.4, 176.0, 3.48, 210.0, 516.0, 96.10, 55.0, 151.0, 12.0, 4.0

Generate more records in the same format.

Please note that the values in the 'Status' column are not actual medical conditions, but rather a shorthand for the different stages of cirrhosis. The values in the 'Drug' column represent different medications that could be used to treat cirrhosis, and the values in the 'Age' and 'Sex' columns represent the age and sex of the patient. The remaining values represent different liver function tests (LFTs) and other relevant metrics.

Please generate at least 1000 synthetic patient records for liver cirrhosis research.

Generate more records in the same format.

You can use any method you want to generate these records, such as:

* Using a statistical model to generate synthetic data based on known distributions of patient characteristics.
* Using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate synthetic data that resembles real-world patient data.
* Using a combination of machine learning algorithms to generate synthetic data that meets certain criteria, such as age, gender, and drug usage.

Please provide me with a large number of synthetic patient records for liver cirrhosis research.
