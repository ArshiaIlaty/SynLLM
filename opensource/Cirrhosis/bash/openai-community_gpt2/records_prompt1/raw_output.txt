Cirrhosis: A Health Issue

Cirrhosis is an infection caused by a blood clot. It is usually fatal. It is one of the most common diseases in the United States.

Symptoms of cirrhosis include:

Fatigue

Fatigue can last for up to a month

Inability to move

Shortness of breath

Liver toxicity

For example, if you have a patient who is on a list of drugs that will cause liver cirrhosis and you want to know how many are causing liver cirrhosis, you can generate more records.

Now, if you have a patient who is on a list of drugs that will cause liver cirrhosis, you can generate more records.

You can also generate more records in a single format.

ID, N_Days, Status, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage

Here are some example records:
1, 400, D, D-penicillamine, 21464, F, Y, Y, Y, Y, 14.5, 261.0, 2.60, 156.0, 1718.0, 137.95, 172.0, 190.0, 12.2, 4.0

This is a nice way to see how you can make your own records from your own records.

You can also use this format:
