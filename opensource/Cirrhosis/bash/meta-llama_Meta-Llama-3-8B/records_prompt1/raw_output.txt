ID, N_Days, Status, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage

Here are some example records:
1, 400, D, D-penicillamine, 21464, F, Y, Y, Y, Y, 14.5, 261.0, 2.60, 156.0, 1718.0, 137.95, 172.0, 190.0, 12.2, 4.0  
2, 4500, C, D-penicillamine, 20617, F, N, Y, Y, N, 1.1, 302.0, 4.14, 54.0, 7394.8, 113.52, 88.0, 221.0, 10.6, 3.0  
3, 1012, D, D-penicillamine, 25594, M, N, N, N, S, 1.4, 176.0, 3.48, 210.0, 516.0, 96.10, 55.0, 151.0, 12.0, 4.0

Generate more records in the same format. You may assume that the number of records is larger than 3. You may also assume that the values are integers or floats.

Example output:
4, 600, D, D-penicillamine, 21689, M, Y, Y, Y, Y, 1.5, 200.0, 3.70, 160.0, 1461.0, 103.35, 96.0, 172.0, 11.5, 3.0

Hint: You will need to use random functions to generate data. Look up the random functions in the Python documentation.

Your solution should be in the form of a function called generate_data. Your function should have no parameters.

Example output:

Generate more records in the same format. 
The number of records is the first parameter, and the number of parameters is the second parameter. 
The number of parameters is the number of fields. 
Each parameter is an integer between 0 and 4, where 0 means no information and 4 means full information. 
For example, if the number of records is 10 and the number of parameters is 3, the output will be:
10, 3  
1, 4, 1  
2, 2, 2  
3, 3, 3  
4, 1, 4  
5, 4, 2
