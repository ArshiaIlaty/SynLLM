You are a synthetic medical data generator. Please generate realistic cirrhosis patient records following these medical rules:

1. Patients with higher Bilirubin (>10.0) or lower Albumin (<2.5) often have advanced disease (Stage 3 or 4)
2. Stage 4 patients usually have Ascites=Y or Edema=Y
3. Low Platelets (<150) and high SGOT (>100) often co-occur
4. Drug is either D-penicillamine or Placebo
5. Ensure values fall within medically reasonable ranges

Features:

1. ID: Patient ID

This tool will automatically generate a medical record for you to use. It can be used to track a patient's medical status, monitor the progress of a transplant, or perform other types of medical tests.

This tool is a collection of code that I wrote to make it easy to generate medical records for various types of medical research. I think it's useful for researchers to be able to quickly generate records that are easy to use and understand. I want to encourage people to try it out and see what I've done with it.

Please let me know what you think.

This program was inspired by the medical records generated by the program I wrote in this tutorial:

https://github.com/sherryk/gen_medical_record

Thanks to all the people who helped me in writing this tutorial!

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Please generate realistic cirrhosis patient records following these medical rules:

1. Patients with higher Bilirubin (>10.0) or lower Albumin (<2.5) often have advanced disease (Stage 3 or 4)
2. Stage 4 patients usually have Ascites=Y or Edema=Y
3. Low Platelets (<150) and high SGOT (>100) often co-occur
4. Drug is either D-penicillamine or Placebo
5. Ensure values fall within medically reasonable ranges

Features:

1. ID: Patient ID  
2. N_Days: Number of follow-up days  
3. Status: C=censored, CL=transplant, D=death  
4. Drug: Treatment type (D-penicillamine or Placebo)  
5. Age: Patient's age in days

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Generate realistic patient records for liver cirrhosis research.

You are a synthetic medical data generator. Please generate realistic cirrhosis patient records following these medical rules:

1. Patients with higher Bilirubin (>10.0) or lower Albumin (<2.5) often have advanced disease (Stage 3 or 4)
2. Stage 4 patients usually have Ascites=Y or Edema=Y
3. Low Platelets (<150) and high SGOT (>100) often co-occur
4. Drug is either D-penicillamine or Placebo
5. Ensure values fall within medically reasonable ranges

Features:

1. ID: Patient ID  
2. N_Days: Number of follow-up days  
3. Status: C=censored, CL=transplant, D=death  
4. Drug: Treatment type (D-penicillamine or Placebo)  
5. Age: Patient's age in days  
6. Sex: F or M  
7. Ascites: Y or N  
8. Hepatomegaly: Y or N  
9. Spiders: Y or N  
10. Edema: N=no, S=slight, Y=marked  
11. Bilirubin: mg/dL  
12. Cholesterol: mg/dL  
13. Albumin: g/dL  
14. Copper: µg/dL  
15. Alk_Phos: alkaline phosphatase (U/L)  
16. SGOT: aspartate aminotransferase (U/L)  
17. Tryglicerides: mg/dL  
18. Platelets: count (×1000/mm³)  
19. Prothrombin: seconds  
20. Stage: histologic stage (1-4)

Please generate records in this exact format:
ID, N_Days, Status, Drug, Age, Sex, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders, Edema, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, Copper, Alk_Phos, SGOT, Tryglicerides, Platelets, Prothrombin, Stage, Prothrombin, and the date of death.

The data will be kept in a file format:

#datetime=<date>

#date=<date>

For example:

datetime=2012-08-16T15:00:00+0200 #datetime=2012-08-16T15:00:00-05:00

Data will be stored in a separate directory to prevent conflicts with other files.

You may also specify a specific date or time to generate records in:

#datetime=2013-08-16T15:00:00-05:00

To generate records in the same day as the patient's death, use the following:

datetime=2013-08-16T15:00:00-05:00

Please do not generate records with a date between <2013-08-16T15:00:00-05:00 and <2013-08-16T15:00:00-05:00>

If you want to generate records that have a specific day, such as a day of the week, you can use the following:

datetime=2013-08-16T15:00:00-05:00

For example:

datetime=2013-08-16T15:00:00-05:00

To generate records on a specific day, use the following:

datetime=2013-08-16T15:00:00-05:00

To generate records on a specific day, use the following:

datetime=2013-08-16T15:00:00-05:00

For example:

datetime=2013-08-16T15:00:00-05:00

For records that have no date, you may use the following:

datetime=2013-08-16T15:00:00-05:00

For records that have a specific day, you may use the following:

datetime=2013-08-16T15:00:00-05:00

You can get started with these basic steps to generate patient records.

1. Start with an empty database. You can also create an existing database, if you have access to it.

2. For each record, enter the record name, the patient's date of birth, and the date of death.

3. Select the record type and the record date from the dropdown list.

4. Select the record type, record date, and the record information.

5. Enter the data into a database.

6. Click the Generate button.

7. The record is ready to be used.

Note: This tutorial requires a basic knowledge of SQL and Microsoft SQL Server.

1. Patients with higher Bilirubin (>10.0) or lower Albumin (<2.5) often have advanced disease (Stage 3 or 4)
2. Stage 4 patients usually have Ascites=Y or Edema=Y
3. Low Platelets (<150) and high SGOT (>100) often co-occur
4. Drug is either D-penicillamine or Placebo
5. Ensure values fall within medically reasonable ranges

Features:

1. ID: Patient ID  
2. N_Days: Number of follow-up days

I have an idea for a new feature. Let's see what is possible.

First, you should have a database of "Patients" for each patient type. Then you need a way to categorize the data, so that it can be easily sorted.

Let's start with a data entry form:

1. Open up your "Patients" database.

2. Under the "Patients" section, create a new table called "Patients" with the following columns:

1. ID: ID of the patient type.

2. N_Days: Number of days between events.

3. Status: If you have a negative "status" you are in a negative state.

4. Drug: If you have a positive "drug" you are in a positive state.

5. Age: Age of the patient at the time of the event.

6. Sex: Gender of the patient at the time of the event.

7. Ascites: Ascites at the time of the event.

8. Hepatomegaly: Hepatomegaly at the time of the event.

9. Spiders: Spiders at the time of the event.

10. Edema: Edema at the time of the event.

11. Bilirubin: Bilirubin at the time of the event.

12. Cholesterol: Cholesterol at the time of the event.

13. Albumin: Albumin at the time of the event.

14. Copper: Copper at the time of the event.

15. Alk_Phos: alkaline phosphatase (U/L) at the time of the event.

16. SGOT: aspartate aminotransferase (U/L) at the time of the event.

17. Tryglicerides: mg/dL at the time of the event.

18. Platelets: count at the time of the event.

19. Prothrombin: seconds at the time of the event.

20. Stage: histologic stage at the time of the event.

You can see the entry form in your "Patients" database.

Now you need a way to sort the data in the "Patients"

You can save these records to a CSV file. You can save these records to a PDF file. You can save these records to an Excel file. You can save these records to an HTML file. You can save these records to a Google Docs spreadsheet. You can save these records to a CSV file in your own SQL database. You can save these records to a CSV file in the database.

You can also create a CSV file by running the following command:

c:\scripts\generate_custom.csv

After running this command, you will get a CSV file with your records in it.

Now you can export your data into a custom form that you can submit to your doctors, insurance companies, and researchers.

How can I generate custom records for a medical condition?

There are a few ways you can generate custom records for a condition.

1. You can use the following procedure to generate custom records for a condition.

You will need to have the following software installed:

Microsoft Excel, Microsoft SQL Server, and the Microsoft Diagnosis and Reporting System (MDSS) software.

2. Enter the following information into the form:
